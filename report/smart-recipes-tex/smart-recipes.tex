\begin{abstract}
  The aim of this document is to find correlations between attributes and characteristics of food recipes and the corresponding ratings and reviews given to that recipe.
  
  Recipes are gathered from the most popular online recipe websites, extracting common attributes and normalizing them between the different representations. Apart from the attributes explicitly included in the recipe descriptions, new properties are being defined by grouping recipe ingredients into different categories. Furthermore, sentiment analysis is performed on the content of recipe reviews, providing a way to determine the corresponding ratings.
  
  Performing a range of different analysis techniques provides a set of hints and best practices to help recipe authors to maximize their ratings by choosing the recipes with attributes most likely to be rated positively.

\section{Introduction}

This document has been prepared for the \textbf{Applied Data Analytics} course at EPFL in the Fall of 2018.

\section{Data acquisition}

The recipe data has been extracted from the \textit{Cooking recipes} database, which is a collection of HTML documents from a wide variety of websites.

\subsection{Data sources}

The analysis has been based on data extracted from the most popular websites containing food recipes. The data included recipes from over 50 websites, all featuring their own custom format and attributes. Since each website required a custom scraper to be built, and each website displays different attributes of recipes and their ingredients, the aim was to select a small number of websites which still offer a good representation of the entire data set. The aim was to work with \nicefrac{2}{3} of the total number of available recipes.

\vspace{5mm}

The top 3 websites containing the most recipes cover about 65\% of all data: 
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0em
    \item http://allrecipes.com
    \item http://www.food.com
    \item https://subscribe.hearstmags.com (food-net)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data import}

The three selected websites provided different recipe attributes in different formats, which needed to be parsed and consolidated into a common format in order to perform meaningful analysis on them.
Common attributes were:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
    \item name
    \item review text
    \item review date
    \item rating
    \item category
    \item ingredient list
    \item nutritional values
    \item preparation time
    \item cooking time
    \item difficulty
    \item serving size
\end{itemize}
These attributes may have different scales, different measurement units, or may be missing altogether. 

The three websites required custom scraping algorithms. The source data volume was about 13 GB, making it feasible to be processed on a single computer. The scraping took 20-30 minutes, the results were stored in \textit{json} format to allow efficient processing.

\subsection{Data cleaning}

Due to the different formats, the data sets had to be cleaned separately. Nutrition information had to be converted to numeric values on a unified scale, using the same measurement units across all recipes. Time values expressed in hours or days needed to be converted to minutes. Rating values had to be scaled to a common range. Some text values had to be converted to numeric values.

\subsection{Review pre-processing}

The content of the reviews had special importance for the analysis. In order to analyze the text, a pipeline was constructed to clear the text. Numbers and other non-alphanumeric characters were removed, and all remaining text was converted to lowercase. Stop words offered little value in terms of semantic analysis, so they were removed. Lemmatizing removed prefixes and suffixes, helping to group similar words. Finally a document term matrix was constructed using both TF-IDF and one-hot encoding matrices.

\section{Preliminary visual analysis}

Once the raw data had been converted into a clean data set with common attributes, they were visualized in order to better understand the characteristics. This analysis was performed before combining the data sets into a single one, allowing comparison between websites.

\subsection{Ratings}

Ratings were found to be dominated by high values. After converting them to a common scale of 3 it was observed that good ratings highly outnumber bad or medium ones.

\subsection{Serving size}

Serving sizes ranged up to 300, but there were only a small number of recipes for more than 50 persons. The 75\% percentile fell to serving sizes of 8 and 12 respectively for the two websites with the most recipes.

\subsection{Reviews over time}

Most reviews have been created between 2000 and 2010, indicating the period when the data had been collected. The density curves suggested different trends for the popularity of the websites. The allrecipes site showed declining review numbers over the years, while food.com had fairly constant activity, and food-net reviews sharply increased towards the end of the period.

\end{center}
\vspace{5mm}

\subsection{Cooking time}

Cooking times ranged from a few minutes to several hours, but the distribution showed that most recipes required less than 1 hour cooking, recipes requiring 30 minutes or less being the most common.

\section{Ingredient clustering}

Comparing recipes based on ingredients is problematic, due to the high number of possible ingredients. By grouping similar ingredients into clusters we were able classify recipes by how many ingredients they contained from each cluster. The following procedure has been performed separately for the different websites, for the sake of simplicity we demonstrate the results from food.com only.

First, measurements and other non-food related words needed to be removed from the review text. For example, words like cup or tablespoon were featured frequently, but were irrelevant to define ingredient clusters. Removing these words and keeping only ingredients resulted in more balanced distribution.

\label{ingredient-dist} Figure 6. Ingredient distribution
\end{center}
\vspace{5mm}

By applying pre-trained word2vec vectors, we mapped each ingredient into a word vector, and projected them to a 2-dimensional plane using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.

\begin{center}

\label{ingredient-vectors} Figure 7. Ingredient word vectors
\end{center}
\vspace{5mm}

We used silhouette analysis to find the optimal number of clusters for the k-means clustering, determining that 29 clusters produced the best performance.

Based on manual analysis of the classified ingredients, the individual clusters have been named accordingly and projected on the 2D plane.

\section{Unified data set}

The next step was to combine the cleaned and pre-processed data from the three websites into a single unified data set, and prepare the attributes so they can be efficiently analyzed.

\subsection{Missing ratings}

Since ratings had special importance for the study, keeping the values on a scale from 1 to 5 allowed more fine grained evaluation rather than compressed ratings on a 1 to 3 scale which was used for the preliminary analysis.

\vspace{5mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{rating-1-to-3}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{rating-1-to-5}
\label{rating-dist} Figure 10. Rating distribution on scales of 3 and 5
\end{center}
\vspace{5mm}

The food-net site contained no rating values at all, only reviews. In order to retain this data, the missing rating values had to be enriched based on the reviews. This has been achieved by using sentiment analysis and logistic regression where both reviews and ratings were available, and use the trained model to predict the missing rating values from the corresponding reviews.

\subsection{Rating bias}

Rating values of 4 were by far the most common, resulting in an implicit bias in the analysis. In order to reduce this bias, the first data set has been oversampled for the logistic regression training, so predicting the missing ratings resulted in a slightly more balanced distribution.

\subsection{Healthiness}

In order to determine how healthy a particular recipe is, the nutrition values have been compared with the commonly recommended daily intake values. Each recipe has been assigned a health grade, based on how many nutrients remain under 50\% of the recommended daily limit in a single serving. Most recipes received a health grade of 3 or 4 on a scale of 6.

\section{Effect on sentiment}

With the data having been converted to the same format and unified into a single data set, the analysis could be performed in order to establish which factors are most likely to influence positive reviews and ratings.

\subsection{Factors}

Before focusing on the ratings, potential factors have been analyzed to understand their distribution. It has been found that meal sizes rarely exceed 12 servings, reviews had been fairly evenly distributed over the period 2003-2011, preparation time is usually under 20 minutes, and cooking time is typically under 1 hour.

\subsection{Preparation and cooking time}

For each recipe an average rating of all reviews has been computed. Recipes have been grouped by preparation and cooking time, choosing 4 distinct ranges, and an additional group for no time specified. Comparing the distribution of average ratings showed that the range between 10 minutes and 1 hour resulted in the highest average ratings for both preparation and cooking times.

\label{time-rating} Figure 13. Preparation and cooking times
\end{center}
\vspace{5mm}

\subsection{Serving size}

Similarly to preparation and cooking times, serving sizes have been grouped to distinct ranges and the distribution of average ratings calculated. The results showed that bigger serving sizes were more likely to receive high ratings and positive reviews, which can be attributed to the fact that cooking for family gatherings and events is more likely to provoke positive feedback.

\label{serving-rating} Figure 14. Serving sizes
\end{center}
\vspace{5mm}

\subsection{Ingredient composition}

During the data preparation the common ingredient clusters have been identified. Firstly we have investigated the correlation between pairs of ingredient types, looking for the most popular combinations of basic types when taking into consideration the average rating of the recipe.

\vspace{5mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{ingredient-pairs} \\
\label{ingredient-pairs} Figure 15. Ingredient correlation
\end{center}
\vspace{5mm}

The above heat-map only identifies weak correlations between ingredient types, such as fish combined with cheese and bread, or vegetables combined with spices.

In order to find the best composition of ingredients, we counted the different ingredients per type. For example if a recipe contained 6 or more fruit ingredients, we labeled it as extensive use of fruits. Five or less ingredients of the same type was labeled moderate use.

The analysis showed that moderate use of ingredients resulted in a well distributed feedback, while extensive use produced favourable results for some ingredient types, such as cheese and bread, pastries and spices.

\label{ingredient-use} Figure 16. Ingredient use
\end{center}
\vspace{5mm}

However, when comparing all possible composition of food types and their ratings, the best combinations were all moderate uses, cheese and bread combined with sauces resulting in the highest number of good ratings.

\subsection{Graph-based analysis}


\section{Conclusion}

The analysis suggests that recipe ratings and reviews can be influenced by carefully choosing certain factors. 

Preparation and cooking time should be reasonably short, preferably less than one hour, indicating a natural limit how much time people are willing to spend with cooking. Interestingly, preparation and cooking times under 10 minutes are not scored as favourably, perhaps because these tend to result in low-quality meals, or perhaps because people visiting food websites do not get so much satisfaction from preparing quick meals.

Recipes for more servings are more successful than those for a few people only. This can be explained by the fact that cooking is ultimately a community activity, where the satisfaction is drawn from the positive opinion of others, such as family members or friends.

Choosing the right ingredients is also important, it is recommended to aim for a balanced and healthy combination of nutrients, as well as moderate use of ingredients of the same food group.

Nonetheless, the impact of choosing the right attributes is relatively minor, as demonstrated by the narrow margins between groups and factors taken into consideration during the analysis. This indicates that user feedback is mainly based on the actual quality of the recipe, rather than on some artificial combination of recipe attributes. This may be the result of the self-regulated nature of public internet portals, ultimately resulting in a fair assessment of the articles by the community.
