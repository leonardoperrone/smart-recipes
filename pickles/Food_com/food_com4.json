There is nothing wrong with the lemoncello made with splenda.. IF you don't compareit to the one made with sugar, you'll be happy. With splenda it is fine. But, side by side with lemoncello made with regular sugar, the sweetness intensity is not there: its slightly less sweet. Also, It is slightly cloudy compared to regular lemoncello. The sweetness is stronger in the lemoncello(regular) made with sugar.Over all, it is really quite close if you are not a 'lemoncello gourmet'. Also, I used the same recipe in both the regular, and the splenda lemoncello experiment. I simply substituted the splenda for the sugar. By the way, we tried lemoncello on vanilla ice cream and topped it all with whipped cream.. Delicious.\r\n\r\nMarch 27...Made this using splenda several times, since the previous post, and wanted to let everyone know that you DO need to increase the splenda because it doesn't make it as sweet as the same amount of sugar does.

First off: this is the kind of recipe I like to make. And it has the potential to become a great recipe! But as it stands, it needs editing. The amounts given are all correct, and made the right consistency white sauce. But I found the instructions confusing -- the filling should be made before one starts on the souffle roll itself. The flour should be added to the milk (for the souffle sauce), not the other way round, which easily causes lumps. Also, one should let the white sauce cool a little before beating in the 4 egg yolks, or the yolks might curdle. Then, there should be a warning to drain the  shrimps after cooking them in the wine! A novice cook will come unstuck here: I drained off 1 1/4 cups fluid from the wine and the shrimps!  Only then could the bechamel sauce be added, to make the filling. Also, tasting as I cooked, I realised this recipe is very bland. I added a seasoned salt containing finely crushed lime rind, coriander seeds and hot pepper. (I should have thought of adding fish sauce too). This recipe uses a lot of bechamel sauce, and I could not face it on top of the roll as well, so only used 1 cup for the filling as instructed, and made do with grated cheddar on top.

LOL) and promised to be a good girl all through the coming year! I gave her a choice of so many colours of glitter which we bought specially for this this evening. She chose red! So, we went by that! She thoroughly enjoyed the poem and she is so excited about it. She kept reading it aloud and practicing how to say it with my dear dad who had to leave his office and listen to her! LOL:) She gave me countless kisses and hugs and this little thing really really made her day! \r\nShe doesn't have a lawn, and so, I told her to sprinkle this outside her home(near her doorstep). She'll do just that, she promised most happily.

I have a few tips for the other cooks out there. (1) Add one tablespoon of vital wheat gluten flour to help with the binding. (2) Let the batter sit for about 10 to 15 minutes before baking, in order to let it become more glutenous so it won't crumble when done baking.  (3) Bake it in a cast iron skillet:  First, preheat the cast iron skillet in the oven.  When the oven is done preheating, it's time to add the batter.  Take out the cast iron skillet with pot holders (It's hot!)  add a tablespoon or 2 of oil, and roll it around greasing the bottom and sides.  Then add the batter, and pop it back into the oven.  Baking in the cast iron skillet give the cornbread nice crispy edges.  I only needed to bake mine for 18 minutes.

Wow, what a hard dish to rate! First of all, I think flying fish are hard to come by!! I wanted to make panfried fish, so found this recipe. I followed it almost to the letter. I had two delicate fillets of Roman, a uniquely South African coastal rock fish. I confess I did not have: limes and cornflakes. I searched for limes but no luck, so used lemons. I have the impression that this is the kind of dish best made by a cook in a professional kitchen! I battled to keep the onion mixture on the fillets. I used a seasoned breadcrumb mixture instead of crushed cornflakes. (We never eat cornflakes and I didn't want to buy a box for the little I needed). The fried fish was delicious, but the covering -- perhaps my mistake -- didn't deliver the punch I expected.  I maintain that this dish probably needs the deft hand of a professional cook, and ... flying fish!! (I served it with a lovely orangey sweet potato on which I used cinnamon liberally, and our own green bean \"stew\" (mush!), as well as a salad and our usual wine with dinner. Thanks!!

It actually isn't necessary to use whole milk (although you do get more, the higher the fat content of the milk).  You could even use diluted evaporated milk or at a push, reconstituted powdered skimmed milk (although powdered milk is nothing like as nice in texture or taste).  I use Cartons of UHT milk (any 'thickness' - but I use skimmed for dietary reasons) as they have already been heat treated to 85 celcius which saves all the mucking about bringing it to a near-boil.\r\n\r\nFor interest, given time and the correct temperature/environment for their cultures to do their thing Buttermilk+milk = more buttermilk, Buttermilk strained=quark, Buttermilk+cream = creme fraiche.\r\nYoghurt+milk=more yoghurt, yoghurt+cream=yoghurty tasting cream, yoghurt strained=strained yoghurt a.k.a Greek Style yoghurt (provided you don't strain it too far and you do stir it till it hasn't got any lumpiness), yoghurt completely strained = Yo-chee (which tastes a lot like quark, but isn't!)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this method for straining either - sorry!  Much easier just to use a couple of sheets of good quality kitchen towel (I discovered) as you can throw them away when you've finished and provided you're gentle, they are strong enough but porous enough to do the job.  Also you should keep gently stirring and mixing the stuff you're straining as it takes miles less time to strain and produces a much smoother result.\r\n\r\nPersonally I use a couple of old 1960's Bel yoghurt makers as they get to the correct temperature (eventually) and stay there to save me needing to be ultra careful about temperature (which is very important actually).\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few factors involved in yoghurt making and you sort of do it by feel and instinct eventually.  The temperature the milk started at, the temperature the culture started at, the amount of culture to milk, the rapidity with which the whole lot gets to, and stays at, the correct temperature (about 100 Fahrenheit) etc all affect it very dramatically along with the amount of time you 'yogg' for.  Finally the place you pick needs to be as completely away from all vibration as you can manage - leave it alone until it's done.  And personal experience has shown it takes a lot longer than many would have you belive - I usually go for about 10 1/2 hours using 2 heaped tblsps starter yoghurt to 2 litres milk with my particular machines.  The longer you leave it the more 'yoghurty' it gets i.e. the acidity or sourness increases.  For these quantities with my machines this works out lovely and smooth with a nice gentle hint of yoghurty flavour.\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful btw! :)  Actually Yo-Chee is very nice - very occasionally I do make it myself when I have a requirement for it and it really does taste a lot like quark, but really, it isn't!\r\n", "calories": "2417.1", "saturatedFatContent": "75.3", "cookTime": "15 mins", "sodiumContent": "1617.9", "fiberContent": "0.0", "servings": "1/2", "date": "December 08, 2002", "sugarContent": "211.0", "proteinContent": "129.9", "fatContent": "130.8", "prepTime": "24 hrs "}, {"category": ["Cheese", "Eggs/dairy", "German"], "carbohydrateContent": "182.1", "cholesterolContent": "406.3", "review_date": "July 24, 2009", "name": "Quark (German Cheese)", "review": "I agree with Ethan.

I reserved the fresh minced clams until the end so that they would not get overcooked and rubbery (thanks for that tip too!). The stock seemed a little thin, so I added two tablespoons of Idahoan instant buttery potato, sprinkling it in the broth and letting it dissolve. It thickened the broth and the taste was wonderful--flavor from the soup stock, half and half and clam juice--plus richness from the instant potatoes. I added half a stick of butter to the bacon when it was cooked before I put the onions in too.

Wrapped the brisket in foil and baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 4 hours.   When it was done, I removed the brisket and let it cool about an hour.  Sliced it about  1/4-inch thick , with my electric knife, and layed the slices back down in the sauce.  Then reheated it in the oven for a few minutes.  WHOA MOMMA!!!  DELICIOUS!!

I altered the recipe & got it pretty darn close! First of all, there is nowhere near enough lemon in this recipe. I added 2 tsp lemon juice & the zest of one lemon to the cake mix. Then I add 2 TBSP lemon juice to the filling-- it's sickeningly sweet otherwise. Additionally, after I cut the cake in 1/2, I drizzled about 2 tsp of lemon juice on the dry cake. This does not make it overly lemony or sour. It brings it up to par with Olive Garden's. \n\nTip1: Double the filling if you want it to spread over the entire outside of the cake as well as between layers.

Two out of four thought there was too much tomato paste in the recipe so I dropped that to 2 oz. and added  1/4 cup more hot water.  For my test recipe I bought an 8 oz. package of man made lobster chunks.  It is made from pollock.  The first tester commented that the 'lobster'  was wonderfully tender with no tough bits.  The other three testers never noticed that it was not real lobster either.  That alone makes this recipe extra easy to do.  I had freshly cracked crab left over from my crab sutffed portobello mushrooms so added that to real fresh lobster I used in the final bisque.  Dinner guests raved about the bisque.  Oh, used Louisiana hot sauce because I did not have tabasco and as one of the other reviewers suggested ran the mixture (prior to adding the cream/butter) thru the blender to make it creamier.

I cooked two beets just to be sure I could get enough thin slices but I only ended up with 7-8 that I could roll.  I took the other slices and assembled them \"oreo-style,\" putting filling inside two slices.  They turned out just fine and it's a good alternative if someone doesn't have a mandoline. The tempura gave just the right amount of crunch without covering up the flavor of the rollatinis, and the glaze was perfect and added just a touch of sweetness.  I had to make the glaze twice -- the first time I was assembling the rolls at the same time, and it quickly went from being slightly syrupy to too sticky and thick to drizzle, so the second time I gave it my full attention and got it off the heat just as it was thickening.

I might be slightly tempted to add some garlic next time as I am mad about that too, but really, there is no need as it's a rich spinach-y flavour and a full bodied thick soup. I bought the cream but after stepping on the scales today decided not to add it (sigh) and went soup au natural but didn't miss the cream after all.

I mixed it all nicely together in a microwave bowl and microwaved these chips on HIGH power level for 7 minutes 29 seconds to be precise! Please note that I did not apply any oil to my bowl and these chips were wonderful - they did not stick to the bowl, though I admit, they did stick to each other, but that was fine, really. They scooped out beautifully and I served them to bro with some tomato ketchup on the side. He was really delighted when I told him that these are no oil French fries! He was really thrilled on hearing that. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. No more of the French fries on the stove with oil and the mess of draining the excess oil on kitchen paper napkins. We'll go with this recipe hereafter!

There are a few changes I would make however (or at least clarifications).  When you saute mushrooms, do not do it for more than 2 minutes to keep them crisp, or they become soggy and gross (also add in 1 Tbsp wine to give them more flavor).  Onions/garlic should be sauteed for no more than 5 minutes. We used 1/2 of a sweet onion, and 4 cloves of garlic.  Also make sure to tenderize the meat before hand, so that it can soak up all of the flavor, and the muscles are not as chewy.

This one is a good one with a pretty authentic Mexican flavor.  I noticed that one reviewer was not happy with the \"spiciness\" of the jalapenos.  I can immediately think of two reasons that could happen.  First it is the chilies themselves, jalapenos used to have a reputation for heat but now most of them seem to be too mild to be of much use.  I believe this is because so many of them are now force fed with fertilizers and water to make them grow faster and thus generate more profits.

I also tried it with lime juice, which was very good (actually, I made that first, since I'd started the recipe before realizing I was out of lemons) I used up the last bit of the one with lime today, mixing it with some lightly steamed (still crispy) cabbage that was leftover from dinner last night.

I omitted the powdered sugar and replaced it with a brown sugar & Splenda combination. I mixed it really well to get it nice & smooth. Next time I might try placing it in the blender to get it even finer but it worked out just fine as it was. I did 3/4 of these with bread and the remainder with 1 point tortillas. I found that I do like the bread better than the tortillas, suprisingly! Also I used up every drop of the butter but had at least half of the cinnamon-sugar mix left so I'll reduce it by half next time. When my hubby got home & tried them he LOVED it! Again, wonderful recipe that was fun & easy to make. By the way, with my adjustments & brands they come out to 2 points each.

I am a self made cook. One thing I would change would be the noodles they really need to be Chow Mein style, Yakisoba noddles work as well. I am pretty sure Panda express fries their noodles or uses noodles that have been previously fried. When making the noodles I have found that cooking them lightly works best. Then you finish cooking them in the mixture.  I also put less sugar than what they call for. I have also had to double the sauce they call for on the rest of the ingredients. I do not own a wok but that is the best way to cook it right. The veggies should be lightly cooked( to simulate this using a frying pan add the longer cooking veggies first cook with half of the sauce. add all veggies until they are all lightly cooked but not soft(still slightly crunchy). Remove from heat. Refry the noodles separate with sauce then add it all the the mixture and serve. These are my suggestions. Oh also you should not use toasted sesame oil. it has a distinct flavor not found in their Chow Mein. I saw another Panda recipe that called for un-toasted Sesame oil and  Vegetable mixed( that is more accurate I think).

This recipe is wonderful. I had a ton of potatoes from our garden and was looking for ways to use them. My kids love tater tots, but I hardly ever buy them. We try to stay away from processed and pre-prepared foods, so was tickled when I found this recipe. I cooked my potatoes in the microwave like a baked potato, and then when they came out I used my food processor to chop them up. Worked great. I then added remaining ingredients (I used dehydrated onions though) and placed my mixture into a disposable pastry bag, snipped off the end and piped out long potato rolls.

Even though I made one big mistake by undercooking the potato, it was still very good (I didn't get the really smooth mash that is required here - a ricer would be a perfect tool to use).  And my gnocci shape was so-so, but I went on youtube and watched a few people do it - eventually holding a fork in one hand and running a piece of gnocci over it with the other...took me ages at first but once I got it the process was pretty quick. The sauce was really good, I had some roasted garlic on hand so I used that up.  The only thing I'm wondering is whether or not that should have read 2 tsp instead of 2 tbsp of both basil and oregano.

When I got back I separated it out into balls and started grilling, and voila!  Beautiful little breads.  I didn't quite get mine to stretch out to eight inches and they cooked up a tad thick, so I'll give it a better go next time with the rolling pin.  I was skeptical, too, about the 15 second cooking time, but they really do cook through when you flip them and do both sides.

A couple of notes, however. First one poster said monterey jack doesn't melt good ... I use it all the time and it melts great, but for this I did use Asadero for the flavor.  I used heavy cream which I think worked better, but half and half should be fine, I use it often. I really enjoyed the onions, although I used a shallot (not much difference there) and didn't use as much (just shy of 2 tablespoons), but would have no problem using the full amount, cilantro, but I added it at the end so it didn't get an odd taste.\n\nNow, a few important notes.  If you are NOT using heavy cream or half and half and using light cream or milk ... it may and probably will separate.  One solution, simply sprinkle a little flour, just a teaspoon with the cheese and it won't happen. Also, heat to medium. NOT TO a boil, just a simmer. A boil even a light boil can make it separate.  Make sure to heat the cream first and USE a double boiler to control the heat. Not directly on and NOT the mirowave.  Warm the cream and stir in the onion, chilies, serrano, cumin (only 1/2 teaspoon) was all that was needed for me, and salt I didn't find was necessary.  Warm to medium heat and cook 3-4 minutes. Slowly stir in the cheese until all is melted. Finally add in the cilantro at the end.\n\nServe.  Creamy ... but yes, this is a NOT smooth cheese like velveeta, as you can tell by the green chilies, but it has great creamy flavor and texture. I do agree that there is too much cumin and I am a fan. And I just cut down on the onion for more of the cheese flavor, but honestly, it is a very simple easy good recipe. You can always omit the cilantro or just use as a garnish if you are someone who doesn't like cilantro.  For me it added a nice flavor.\n\nVery nice recipe.
