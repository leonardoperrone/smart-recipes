I split one Oreo double stuff and, after putting in the candy corn tail feathers, sat the \"tail\" firmly into the white filling of the split cookie.  I dabbed a bit of chocolate frosting onto the bottom and one side of the Rollo and \"glued\" it to the \"tail\" and the white \"snow-covered\" ground.  \"Glued\" the malted milk ball onto the Rollo.  I noticed that some of the candy corn didn't have the white tip so I broke of the orange tips for the \"beaks\"... which I \"glued\" on w/ the frosting.  By this time the turkeys were starting to get some personality!  I used yellow gel to make \"feet\" on the \"snow\" under the turkeys.  I used red decorating gel to make the \"snoods\" and \"wattles\" across the \"beak\" and hanging down one side.  I used blue decorating gel to make \"eye\"... too cute.

Like other reviewers, I was afraid the amount of broth indicated would not be enough for the amount of time it would be cooking.  I also omitted the dumplings, as DH dislikes the texture.  I instead served it with classic buttermilk biscuits.  It turned out delicious and savory with just the right amount of each essential component of this classic dish.

There are a few things I done different that made it taste richer.  Instead of cooking the potatoes on the stove top, (I think this maks them watery) I baked them in the microwave with the skin on.  I let them cool down and then peel them and cut them into chuncks. They stay together much better, and they have a much better taste to them. If you are using red potatoes, which I prefer, leave the skin on them.  I also saute my onions and garlic in a pan with butter really slow so they don't brown.  I put the chicken broth in the pot first, then the onions and butter.  I let the cream cheese get to room temp, and then use my wire strainer to mash the cream cheese through it with the back of a spoon.  It dissolves much easier.  After the soup comes to a slow boil, I add the potatoes and turn in down on simmer for a while.  When I serve it, I put crispy bacon cumbles on top along with cheddar cheese and green onions.  I also think it is good with a dollop of sour cream.  Bake a pan of corn bread, and you have the most delicious meal you could ever eat.  I use one cream cheese to one carton of chicken broth.

It's kind of sour, but it's not at all like lemon juice. My advice is, if you're not making Rejuvelac, leave out lemon juice. I've made many vegan cheese recipes, and if I don't have a batch of Rejuvelac on hand I just deal with i and omit it. They all come out well. \n    Real secret is the nutritional yeast. That's what gives it the cheesy flavor. Also, if you soak the raw cashews for at least 2 hours before making recipe, this sauce will come out much smoother, almost like melted Velveta. Also reduce the water to a 1 to 1 1/2 ratio (cashews to water). You can add additional water to thin if you need to..much easier to thin a thick sauce than to thicken up a thin sauce.

I have just finished making my third batch, and have tinkered with the recipe each time...it lends itself well to variations. I love the combination of chocolate with nuts, so I have added 1/4 cup of sifted cocoa powder to the vanilla whey, and added 4 packets of Equal to sweeten the cocoa. I also toasted the oatmeal for about 8 minutes at 350F to enhance the flavour prior to adding it to the liquids. This mix required about another 1/3 cup of milk, probably because of the cocoa. Because my daughter has a peanut allergy, I used crunchy almond butter, and added a capful of almond extract to the milk.

I don't have a true donut cutter, so I had to use a small plastic cup turned upside down to cut the donut and then a twist top from a bottle of soda to make the middle hole. I was able to get 32 donuts from this recipe, but will probably use a larger cup next time. I baked 1/2 the recipe and fried the rest. If watching calories, the baked were good, but the fried were definitely tasier (surprised?). I used Kittencal's Easy Bakery-Style Donut Glaze (#179685) for a quick glaze. This made the donuts even better, and I'll probably continue to experiment with other glazes since there seem to be so many yummy ones on the 'Zaar. Now, cooking notes: After cutting the donuts, I let them rise for 45 minutes (instead of 30). For the baked version, I baked them at 450F, but only had to leave them in for 5 minutes.

Now that I've had it, I can tell you there aren't enough stars to rate this highly enough.  If I had to choose between this cake and a regular chocolate cake made with wheat flour, I would choose this one hands down, no contest--!!!  This is one fantastic cake recipe.  The texture is moist and dense and lusciously chocolate (it reminds me a little of the \"Tasty Cake\" cupcakes I grew up with, but even better), very \"brownie-ish\" for those brownie addicts among us.  I think you can sub some of the flour varieties out pretty easily, especially the starchy ones like tapioca (I substituted potato starch for that one, since tapioca is made from yuca root, which is used like a potato in Central & South America).  The recipe came together easily and pretty quickly.  We do not even use a topping on this cake, as it is irresistible just as it is (however, for my grandson's special day we used a Cool Whip frosting made with chocolate pudding and a little less milk than the recipe called for).  To be honest, we just weren't counting on everyone's wanting seconds and thirds the way they did!!  We are not big on keeping sweets around the house, but I will admit we had to make this one again the next day for those who \"didn't get enough\" the first time around (it is awesome cold out of the refrig as well--had to cut it into bite-size \"guiltless\" chunks to keep it from disappearing within the hour).

Kind of liked this idea and it would be fairer to say I did my own thing with it as I had to make do with what I had available and quantities available (- was using some left-over cooked barley that I'd been sticking in things for days but it was really about time it was used up) - and the fact that I made at at 1 a.m. to fill a huge hunger hole.  No way I wanted that much caffeine at that time of day! :)  I don't keep fresh milk of any sort so sprinkled what I reckoned was about the right quantity of skimmed milk powder over the cooked barley and added some of the barley water which I'd retained after cooking it in the first place.  Didn't add egg white as I didn't fancy it and never use salt if I don't absolutely need to.  In retrospect I would have been much better with the egg white for sure.  Added a few too many raisins, a bit too much cinnamon, and nutmeg and ginger (which I should have left out) and microwaved it because I was very hungry (!) until it boiled and was in danger of getting messy all over the microwave.  Then I dropped the microwave down to defrost setting and cooked it for ages until enough of the water had been absorbed by the raisins and it was sufficiently creamy.  Added some granulated sweetener, topped with sweetened nonfat greek-style yoghurt and pieces of cooked apple and yet more cinnamon ! :)  I kind of massacred it really and still liked it and would do it again but would not play about with the recipe so much next time.  I think it would really have been miles better baked slowly.  I think the nutmeg was a good idea, the ginger wasn't and I put too much cinnamon in - it kind of took over and it would have been nicer to taste more of the maltiness of the barley.  If not preparing from such a  calories conscious angle I would have liked a small amount of butter in with to be fair - I think it would have been a big improvement - but like yourself would generally prefer to avoid the fat if I can.  Will do it again, baked and with the coffee next time (and some nutmeg :).  I'd probably put some large pieces of apple into the pudding too - I think it would be nice.  Probably next time I still use the yoghurt and a nice dollop of good extra-fruit strawberry jam.  Definitely a keeper of a recipe with real traditional roots that gives plenty of scope for play.  Might be nice with large chunks of dried apricot or other large dried fruit in it too instead of apple.  I think this one will see me having lots of fun coming up with different additions to and on it :)  Probably also really nice chilled,  served with ice-cream and fruit or jam/syrup.  I hope more people give this a go as it's a great recipe that is based on a dessert/meal going back hundreds of years and has been popular with all age-groups because it's really a very nice thing to eat.  Tastes a lot like a nice creamy, malty rice pudding that's chewier and just uniquely nice.  Barley has some superb health benefits too of course!

I also took JanetB's suggestion of adding some peppermint extract to the batter. I have to admit that, even being as huge a fan of peppermint as I am, I wondered how well it would work in a non-chocolate cake. But, as it turns out, the flavor (and the aroma) reminds me most strongly of Hickory Farms' Melt Away Mints, the pastel-colored nonpareil-covered butter mints that I've loved since childhood. In fact, people have come back to the cake just to get another glob of frosting. The only change I would make, I think, is increasing the amount of bourbon. I put in 2 tablespoons (with a doubled portion of sauce) and still there's just barely a hint of bourbon flavor. If you're not a big bourbon fan, though, that amount might be just right!

You find this nearly all over Italy and it is not Italian-American food but Italian food; the real deal. Foods are not over done in flavors in any way in Italy and it is said there that if you can smell garlic when one is cooking that they have used too much. While there are the arribiatas and such, Italian gravy is a standard. While garlic may be used in nearly all cooking, sometimes to feed 10+ people there is a single clove. The essences of flavors are important, not a kick in the face for the most part.

How much olive oil? 3 cans of tomatoes can be 16 oz or 28 oz cans, I used the 28 oz cans; how much basil should be used and when does it go into the sauce? I used the pork neck bones and the mild Italian sausage as directed and figured that would add lots of flavor, but unfortunately it did not.  My family politely ate one plate, but no one went back for seconds and they told me thanks for all the work that it was pretty good. \"My hubby then said, babe if you want to stick with Prego, I'm fine with that since its less work and tastes better than this stuff.\"  I will admit the meatballs were very tender, but nothing spectacular as far as taste. Again, this could be due to my error somehow, maybe someone can advise what I may have done wrong or can describe the flavor the sauce should have?

Just ignore it if it did.\n\nSo, this recipe is a good starting off point... I experimented with it a little to make my own version because the bread I had when I baked it this way was WAY to overpowering with the taste of the baking powder.\n\nThis is what I did:\n\nMix in a bowl:\n\n3 cups flour (I used all-purpose white, it turned out fine)\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon garlic powder (not necessary, I like the little kick it gives my bread though. You can try experimenting by adding cinnamon or any other herb of your choice)\n\nIn a separate bowl, mix:\n\n1 1/2 cups liquid (I used plain old water)\n1/4 cup liquid fat (I used olive oil)\n\nThen combine liquid into dry ingredients, mix. \n\nI found I didn't need to add any extra flour, the consistency is supposed to be sticky and not firm. I oiled my hands and shaped it into the roll form I wanted, then laid it onto my pan which was coated with olive oil. I cut an 'X' in my loaf... A nifty little trick you can use is to flour up your knife to do this, as just doing it without the flour can be kind of hard and not leave much of a mark at all.\n\nThe cooking time may vary, just keep an eye on the top of the loaf, when it starts to firm up and take shape a little, take it out and rub some melted butter on the top of the bread, then put it back in until it's finished.\n\nYou'll know it's finished when the top of the bread is a little brown.

I then added my chicken broth, 3 carrots I had peeled and sliced 1/4 inch, and a cup of frozen peas.  I then added the chicken back in, covered it, and baked it at 350 for 20 minutes.  I then uncovered the pan and spread the honey mustard sauce over the top, and finished baking, uncovered, for 15 minutes longer.  And, since I had no yogurt, I used an equal amount of sour cream.  The result was the most delicious honey mustard skillet I have ever had, and the carrots were perfectly cooked.  I do think that there could be more rice, but I'd have to increase the broth to compensate, and there could be even more vegies as well.  The rice was perfectly cooked and everything else was excellent, including a sauce with a pleasant, bright flavor.  Thanks for giving me the enspiration to make this dish.  I hope you don't mind my giving it no stars, but I thought it was only fair since I made so many changes to the original recipe.", "calories": "834.5", "saturatedFatContent": "11.9", "cookTime": "1 hrs ", "sodiumContent": "1118.3", "fiberContent": "0.9", "servings": "4 ", "date": "May 24, 2007", "sugarContent": "20.5", "proteinContent": "52.6", "fatContent": "42.0", "prepTime": "10 mins"}, {"category": ["Main dish", "Chicken", "Poultry"], "carbohydrateContent": "58.3", "cholesterolContent": "187.7", "review_date": "May 04, 2008", "name": "Baked Chicken and Rice With Honey-Mustard Sauce", "review": "This recipe is absolutely Fantabulous!

I love the taste of real whipped cream and not the fake kind used by bakeries of grocery stores.  However, whipped cream is normally impossible to decorate with but not with this recipe.  I was able to decorate my daughter's baptism cake with it and even used the air brush technique and it took well.  The cake sat on display at an indoor reception in August without deflating, weeping, melting, whatever.  The clouds stayed puffy, the colors stayed put, and it tasted great still.  Whipped cream always tastes better chilled so I actually made a second sheet cake to keep in the fridge and served that while I returned the decorated one back in the fridge.  We actually ended up not having to serve that one but we sure did enjoy it later that day an it still looked beautiful after all that displaying and transferring.

I'll make this again but - unless it's for guests - I'll skip the delicious cream (sadly, just not so healthy) and serve the fruit with Greek yoghurt. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Jess.

I cooked this soup in my 6-quart slow-cooker, (which I highly suggest one uses a 6-quart slow-cooker) and I cooked the broth ingredients... the turkey, vegetables, spices, and water for exactly 13 hours. I did however add a few more spices to the broth, to make it more flavorable, such as... 2 Tablespoons of the chicken bouillon granules, as per instructed in the cooking directions, and not the 2 tsp., as listed in the ingredients, but I only added 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper, (rather than a 1/2 teaspoon) plus I also added 2 bay leaves. After straining the broth, and returning it to the slow-cooker, you will end up with 10-1/2 cups of the broth. When it came to adding the ingredients to make the soup, (the next day) I only added a 1/2 cup of diced onion, (rather than the 2 onions) and I thought that was more than enough onion (taste wise). But, I did add 4 carrots, thinly sliced (rather than the 2 carrots) plus I added 2 large cloves of garlic, minced. Instead of chopping the celery, I thinly sliced it, and the total amount of spices I added to the recipe were as follow... 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp dried basil leaves, 1/2 tsp dried majoram, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, and 1/2 tsp dried thyme. As for the noodles, I added 7 ounces, (3-1/2 cups) of Creamettes Dumpling Egg Noodles, but next time I will use a firmer type of pasta, such as... Rotini (spiral shaped) macaroni, and add 8 ounces (2 cups). Also, I did add more turkey meat to the soup. I added 3 cups.

I love that it uses brown rice  instead of white + quinoa for protein.  I made this as written, except that I used Vegenaise instead of mayonnaise and mixed it with sri racha instead of wasabi.  It made the sushi creamy and a tiny bit spicy.  Yum yum.  It was pretty easy to make.  The instructions were really clear, and I like that you pointed out that it's still delicious even if it's not pretty.  The only part I had trouble with was cutting the rolls.  I probably need to sharpen my good knife.  My husband said that the sushi chefs leave the plastic wrap on top of the roll while cutting, and that actually helped quite a bit.  Another friend later said that it helps to lay to rolls right next to each other and cut them together.  I'll have to try that next time...and their definitely will be a next time.

As this is a 1961 recipe, I had to tweak a little. I used the long English cucumber which needs no peeling (and with tiny, soft seeds). This was not available in 1961. It also looks more appetizing with the skin on. I used apple cider vinegar, and about 1/2 tablespoon sugar to counteract the acidity. As she gives no baking time, I baked (and stirred a few times) at 350 deg F/180 deg C. I have a fan-convection oven which is really hot, so after 20 mins. the julienned cukes were sizzling in the butter, colour intensified but unchanged, and I took them out. Due to time constraints they were made in the early afternoon, and warmed up again at night for dinner, (which was tomatoey chicken stew with potatoes, S A stewed green beans and a large mixed salad). I chose the herby variation -- with dill, parsley and some chopped spring onions. The fact that the cucumber strips held their shape, didn't shed any more water, and was officially a hot veggie, was quite a surprise!! Not haute cuisine, but a pleasant alternative to the usual veggies. I'll make this again, and I thank you wholeheartedly for posting this recipe!!! As the stars say, we loved it! REVIEW UPDATED, MARCH 6, 2008: What a standby this proves to be!! I was short of fresh veggies tonight and most of the time I cook from scratch. But I had a large English cucumber. I used this recipe again, as I also needed to bake chicken pieces in the oven. I flavoured with sweet, chopped onion, garlic chives, Maldon salt and quite a lot of coarse black pepper, and used olive oil. As delicious as always -- I had to explain to husband what it was! He's so used to cukes only used in salad! I did not have time to let the cucumber shed liquid, but it was NOT liquidy at all and baked beautifully. Thanks, it's lovely!! Great standby when you are short of other fresh vegetables! UPDATED AGAIN: Another thank you for a reliable recipe which, in the sticks where I live (a small quiet coastal village) has been made yet again. Tonight I did not have time for long marinating -- maybe 30 mins. -- and as said, the baking time is short.

I bought fresh minced clams (in their juice) and used half and half. After I browned 4 slices of Oscar Mayer bacon and a whole vidalia onion (chopped); I added two cans of cream of celery soup, two cans of half and half and all of the clam juice to make a broth. Separately, I boiled potatoes, and acknowledging the other reviews, I only peeled and cut up two potatoes so as not to make it too potato-ey. I reserved the fresh minced clams until the end so that they would not get overcooked and rubbery (thanks for that tip too!). The stock seemed a little thin, so I added two tablespoons of Idahoan instant buttery potato, sprinkling it in the broth and letting it dissolve. It thickened the broth and the taste was wonderful--flavor from the soup stock, half and half and clam juice--plus richness from the instant potatoes. I added half a stick of butter to the bacon when it was cooked before I put the onions in too. Now, the chowder is just simmering under a boil--stirring so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the Le Creuset pot--adding the clams last and letting them heat through for flavor but not overcooking them is the last step. Coarse pepper ground on top. I bought two pumpernickel bagels at the farmer's market and will toast them and spread cream cheese on top to go with this hearty chowder for our supper by the New England coast.

The dough was difficult to work with (like working with wet sand), and reminded me of a crumbly pie crust dough.  Chilling the dough helped, and I think a tad more flour would help even more (like 2 cups total).  What worked best for me was to divide the batch into four pieces and roll out each piece with lots of flour on a piece of parchment paper, while keeping the rest in the refrigerator.  I decided to make strudel shaped cookies: I rolled out a rectangle, spooned the filling down the center and lifted the sides of the rectangle to cover the center (using the paper base came in handy).  I placed the shaped logs in the freezer and when firm enough transfered to the baking pan seam side down.  Also, I would suggest working with relatively narrow dough rectangles (ca. 3 inches) as the logs flattened and expanded while baking. Two pounds of fresh figs made a lot of filling, way too much than for the strudel shaped cookies, maybe layering like in the recipe would use up more filling, but it still seems that there is A LOT of fig preserve (which will be great for breakfast!).", "calories": "315.2", "saturatedFatContent": "5.2", "cookTime": "30 mins", "sodiumContent": "204.0", "fiberContent": "2.1", "servings": "1 ", "date": "August 23, 2005", "sugarContent": "41.3", "proteinContent": "3.0", "fatContent": "8.7", "prepTime": "1 hrs 30 mins"}, {"category": ["Rolled cookies", "Cakes", "Cookies and brownies"], "carbohydrateContent": "58.1", "cholesterolContent": "37.2", "review_date": "July 03, 2012", "name": "Fig Newtons (Homemade)", "review": "These are delicious!

It turned out chocolatier than I would have expected, which was nice. I won't comment on the baking part because I messed it up ( not your fault.  Demented oven). I used corn oil, light cream cheese, light margarine, 1 6/7 libs icing sugar and strawberry & banana flavouring instead of red & yellow colouring.The  colouring was, surprisingly, perfect - peachy skin. It tasted fab too, and really set off the chocolate cake. The icing was slightly runny and didn't harden immediately - which is good when you have to ice a big cake like this ! There was loads of icing left over - I have a tupperware of it in the fridge now :P - so I could have split the base and done the middle, although it seemed a bit thin. For the nipples, I didn't tint any icing at all - instead I wound 2 red liquorice whips into  spirals for the areolas and chopped another one up for the nipples (four 2cm sticks each). That worked reasonably well, although you need to make a little hole in the breat to dig in the end of the liquorice whip, otehrwise it unravels!

I don't know if that was right or not, but the pie did stand together, so it apparently worked. I had a hard time incorporating the egg whites into the filling-I had to stir and stir. My guess is that this must be normal since the recipe says to incorporate them gradually. I didn't know how long to chill the filling before I mixed in the Cool Whip, so I let it chill about 1 1/2 hours, until I was ready to plate up my dinner. Then I added in the Cool Whip and put it in the pie crust-this worked out great, because the pie crust didn't get soggy. I topped it with Cool Whip.

There are a few things that I found important in making this recipe taste good though. The apples you use can make or break this recipe. I made this recipe with granny smith apples, and it was pretty good, but nothing really special. Now, when I used Missourri galas, it was extraordinary. My mom said it was better than any apple pie she has had in restaurants. The sweetness of the MO galas really made the difference, and the granny smith's paled in comparison with their tartness. I also used Penzey's spices cinammon which is still fairly new (this is a blend of about 4 different kinds of cinammon). If you ever get ahold of that cinammon, you won't regret it. Don't forget to top each piece off with one or two scoops of vanilla ice cream. Choose a fairly normal or old fashioned vanilla ice cream that doesn't have a fakey vanilla taste like you would find in Blue Bunny for example.

In fact its the ONLY recipe passed down. Chicken Paprikash has been my favorite comfort dish since I was a child. this is the only recipe i know by heart but i wanted to see if there were any better ways to prepare it. (such as your mixing the sour cream separately was brilliant) We make our Dumplings slightly different though. Actually they are more like dumpling noodles. instead of making it dry ours calls for the mixture to be slightly runny (and I like to add a little paprika to the mixture as an extra kick!) then instead of a knife use a spoon to scoop the dough into the boiling water. And only use I/3 of the spoon (the side) and get the dough into the water by knocking the spoon on the edge of the pot and then continuing on to the next. (yes it can be time consuming but the efforts are worth it) make sure to have a straining spoon handy and a cassorole dish with a dab of butter to keep the dumpling noodles from sticking. As you continue one by one spooning the mixture in the pot, some of the dumplings should be rising to the surface so periodically scoup them out with the straining spoon and dump them in the cassirole dish. They should resemble slightly half-moon shaped pieces of chewed up gum (I know that sounds gross but that's the best description I've got). Continue scooping the dough untill its done. This takes a while and this is usually when my grandmother employed my help when I was young and how I learned to make this dish better than anyone in my family including her.

I've heard non-stop negative reviews for attempts to make the Olive Garden dressing. First, I purchased the original bottle at Olive Garden. Wayyy too expensive, there's hardly any dressing, and you're paying for a heavy glass bottle! I was running low, so I wanted to try a few recipes. Thank god I tried this one first... I followed it to par, using light corn syrup and everything else as listed. I let it chill for 3 hours while I ran errands, came back, and sampled each dressing on a plate. Yes, it was very tart, and I'd have to agree, it wasn't quite Olive Garden's dressing. It needed more garlic powder in addition to the fresh garlic. I added probably about 1 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and voila! PERFECT, if not BETTER... The bottled one tastes more bland, and that's probably because of preservatives. This recipe is brighter in taste than the bottled Olive Garden one. Definitely my favorite now...And seriously, side by side, they look almost identical. This recipe turned out a little more yellow than the bottled Olive Garden one, and a little more rustic and chunky than the bottled one, but over all wayyyy better than Olive Garden's own!!!

Most traditional antipasto recipes cannot be home canned safely in a boiling water bath canner. (However, some can be frozen successfully.) When the recipe adds low acid foods such as tuna (or other canned seafood), olives, mushrooms, vegetables and/or oil\u2013 the resulting food mixture needs to be processed at temperatures higher than those that can be reached in a boiling water canner.

This recipe is tried and true and enjoyed by hundreds of cooks for many years. Read the instructions, \"Bring to a boil, stirring constantly to prevent sticking.  Plce mixture IMMEDIATELY INTO HOT STERILIZED JARS, or place in containers for freezing.\"  I think that clearly states the mixture is boiling and jars are sterilized.  To clarify the proceedure, From Company's Comming, Preserves, 1996 edition.\r\n\"The boiling hot food is poured into hot sterilized jars and rims wiped with a clean paper towel dipped in boiling water.  Place sterilized metal lids on jars and screw metal bands on tightly.\"  I should add that the lids and tongs used to apply the lids are taken out of boiling water as are any other utensils used.  The preserves can be left to cool and store at this stage or if you wish you may put them into a boiling water bath, which in this case I have never felt it necessary.  Here is further information:\r\nSealing Jars:Processing in Boiling water bath or pressure canner. - To seal a screw top jar with metal lid, sterilize the lid in boiling water for 5 minutes and place the lid on the jar immediately after filling with the hot mixture being processed. Screw the metal band on securely, but do not tighten. Process in a boiling water bath or pressure canner.  Do not retighten lids after processing jars.  As jars cool, the contents in the jar contract, pulling the self sealing lid firmly aginst the jar to form a vacuum seal.\r\nAnd more:\r\nOpen kettle canning - To seal a screw top jar with metal lid, sterilize the lid in boiling water for 5 minutes and place the lid on the jar immediately after filling with the hot mixture.  Screw the medtal band on tightly, allow to cool.  After the jars have cooled, check for an indentation in the lid to ensure that the jar has sealed.  You may remove the medtal screw bands and store.\r\nand more:\r\nSterilizing:  Jars can be washed, rinsed and sterilized in the dishwasher. Set the dishwasher for the highest water temperature.  (Mine has a setting especially for canning jars ), The jars can also be sterilized in boiling water.

It is rich and creamy and very well balanced.  The bold flavors of the marinated artichoke, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic blend so well with the seasoned pan-browned chicken, the cream, the delicate green peas, and white wine.  The green peas and the sun-dried tomatoes give the dish a vibrant contrasting color and a striking appearance.  You can taste every component individually as you savor their synergy in combination.  \n\nThis is a memorable dish fit for cherished guests, yet it is simple enough to whip up for a casual family meal.  Pair it with some homemade thin crust pizza for appetizers and a green salad and it easily serves five or six people.  \n\nI used Pinot Grigio for the white wine, and it was perfect.  I can't help but wonder how a slightly sweeter wine, maybe a Soave, might do for this dish.  I think it would complement the creaminess of the dish. \n\nI stayed pretty much true to the recipe, although I didn't precisely measure every ingredient.  I used a bit too much flour and had to add a bit more cream to compensate and to get the consistency where I wanted it.  And being cajun, I could not help but add 1/4 tsp of Cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp of white pepper.  Sorry about that.  The dish certainly doesn't need it, it's just my love of cayenne needing satisfaction.\n\nLet me tell you how I came upon Chef VInce Ang's Penne San Remo recipe.  I recently visited Buca di Beppo and ordered their version of this dish.  I was so impressed with it that I decided to see if I could find any hints online to help me make a similar dish.  I am so happy I found this most exquisite example!\n\nThank you Chef Vince Ang.  I love your recipe.  It's a winner.  The way you prepare the chicken makes it much better (more flavorful, and with better consistency) than the over-marinated salty/mushy chicken in the Buca di Beppo dish that inspired your creation.  \n\nTo anyone else considering this recipe, you have my hearty recommendation.

You can find it where the store keeps the special chocolate and imported chocolate.  Also, be sure to follow the recipe!  Use UNSWEETENED coconut, most grocery stores don't sell this.  I had to find mine at a natural health food store.  Mine was organic and more like stripes or large flakes, if yours is this way, just put it in your food processor or blender for a few seconds to chop it down to size.  You could replace the \"vegetable oil\" with coconut oil, if you like the stronger coconut flavor.  I also used Nestle dark chocolate bars.  Hershey's Special Dark would work well also.  Don't be afraid to spend a bit more money, it makes all the difference.  Remember, Fannie May sells these things for nearly $23.00 a pound!  \n\nAlso a helpful tip, if you plan to make several of these, using a teaspoon can be very time consuming and messy.  Try using a cake decorating bag, normally used for icing.  Chill the warm dark chocolate for a while, just until it is more firm, but still kinda gooey.  You can then put the dark chocolate in the bag and use it to rapidly form your \"teaspoon\" sized portions.  If you have silicone ball molds, you can shoot in right in there and avoid the hand rolling technique, which is also very messy, and in my opinion, wastes a lot of chocolate!\n\nHope this was helpful!\n\nHappy Eating!", "calories": "402.1", "saturatedFatContent": "24.3", "cookTime": "0 mins", "sodiumContent": "28.7", "fiberContent": "10.0", "servings": "36 ", "date": "May 29, 2008", "sugarContent": "8.1", "proteinContent": "8.4", "fatContent": "38.9", "prepTime": "3 hrs "}, {"category": ["Candy", "Dessert", "Chocolate"], "carbohydrateContent": "25.5", "cholesterolContent": "11.7", "review_date": "December 07, 2009", "name": "Copycat Fannie May Trinidads", "review": "Once the filling balls are frozen use a toothpick or skewer to pick up the ball and dip into the white chocolate.

My copy calls for 8 cups flour, 1/4 cup baking powder, 3 tbl sugar, 1 1/3 cup powdered milk, and 3/4 cup shortening. The salt is the same. In my class we used 6 cups white flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour. We also used butter flavored crisco.  My recipe reads that this makes 10 cups. This keeps for 3 months in the refrigerator. Variations: Whole Wheat mix - Use 4 cups white flour mixed with 4 cups whole wheat flour. Replace the shortening - use 3/4 cup butter or margarine and replace salt to 2 tsp. or use 2/3 cup canola oil. Overall this is a great recipe. It made the best light biscuits.
