As this is a 1961 recipe, I had to tweak a little. I used the long English cucumber which needs no peeling (and with tiny, soft seeds). This was not available in 1961. It also looks more appetizing with the skin on. I used apple cider vinegar, and about 1/2 tablespoon sugar to counteract the acidity. As she gives no baking time, I baked (and stirred a few times) at 350 deg F/180 deg C. I have a fan-convection oven which is really hot, so after 20 mins. the julienned cukes were sizzling in the butter, colour intensified but unchanged, and I took them out. Due to time constraints they were made in the early afternoon, and warmed up again at night for dinner, (which was tomatoey chicken stew with potatoes, S A stewed green beans and a large mixed salad). I chose the herby variation -- with dill, parsley and some chopped spring onions. The fact that the cucumber strips held their shape, didn't shed any more water, and was officially a hot veggie, was quite a surprise!! Not haute cuisine, but a pleasant alternative to the usual veggies. I'll make this again, and I thank you wholeheartedly for posting this recipe!!! As the stars say, we loved it! REVIEW UPDATED, MARCH 6, 2008: What a standby this proves to be!! I was short of fresh veggies tonight and most of the time I cook from scratch. But I had a large English cucumber. I used this recipe again, as I also needed to bake chicken pieces in the oven. I flavoured with sweet, chopped onion, garlic chives, Maldon salt and quite a lot of coarse black pepper, and used olive oil. As delicious as always -- I had to explain to husband what it was! He's so used to cukes only used in salad! I did not have time to let the cucumber shed liquid, but it was NOT liquidy at all and baked beautifully. Thanks, it's lovely!! Great standby when you are short of other fresh vegetables! UPDATED AGAIN: Another thank you for a reliable recipe which, in the sticks where I live (a small quiet coastal village) has been made yet again. Tonight I did not have time for long marinating -- maybe 30 mins. -- and as said, the baking time is short.

For those who think they didn't come out brown enough, I will tell you that when Pizza Hut makes these (I was a General Manager there for several years), prior to these going in the oven they are brushed with liquid butter oil.

This would also aid in browning.  If you want them browner than they're turning out for you, I would suggest at the end, to turn your oven up higher or even to the broil setting for a minute.

Now, I'm assuming that is because most people have Bisquick and already use it all of the time?  Well, I don't because it is not that healthy (with the fat and bleached flower)which is why I made this in the first place.  I did a 'zaar search to find other Buisquick knock off recipes to get the instructions, but they did not work all that great with this mix.  I made buiscuits that were flat, crunchy and sweet and were more like a cookie.  The batter was so runny I had to add a lot more mix, thus ending up with more \"buiscuits\" than we could eat.  When I made waffels, which turned out pretty good, but again were too sweet and a bit too oily (this mix and the instructions on how to make the mix both have oil in them).  Hubby said that they were like muffins.  So, my request to make this a five-star recipe is to add the instructions on how to use the mix.  Next time I will use about 1/4 cup of sugar.

I then garnished it with a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of fresh cilantro, and served it with a simple light salad and crusty bread and butter.  To die for!  Heaven!

I found that laying the bird on his back to attach the body, head, and beak worked well as gravity kept them in place while the icing dried.

I dabbed a bit of chocolate frosting onto the bottom and one side of the Rollo and \"glued\" it to the \"tail\" and the white \"snow-covered\" ground.  \"Glued\" the malted milk ball onto the Rollo.  I noticed that some of the candy corn didn't have the white tip so I broke of the orange tips for the \"beaks\"... which I \"glued\" on w/ the frosting.  By this time the turkeys were starting to get some personality!  I used yellow gel to make \"feet\" on the \"snow\" under the turkeys.  I used red decorating gel to make the \"snoods\" and \"wattles\" across the \"beak\" and hanging down one side.  I used blue decorating gel to make \"eye\"... too cute.

I don't think it was really my changes of ingredients but my change of rolling technique that made the difference:  I cut a large Ziplock bag in half down the sides, so it opened out flat, then put the dough between the halves to roll it.  I did not use any extra flour to roll them.  About half way through, I had to cut a new bag, because the one I was using was beginning to stick. I didn't bother cutting circles, because I was working very quickly.  Between the pieces of plastic, I was able to get the pieces very thin, and I think that made all the difference.  For the record, however, the ingredient changes were:  white rice flour instead of brown which I had used the first time (the recipe doesn't specify), Bob's Red Mill baking mix instead of chickpea flour (just the closest thing I had on hand), all tapioca flour instead of tapioca and potato starch (I used up my potato starch making gluten, egg, and corn free marshmallows) 1 1/2 tsp xanthan gum and no guar gum (don't have any, and I thought it needed more than the original recipe called for, to prevent breaking and make them more flexible), and regular butter (don't have coconut butter, and didn't want olive oil).  Whether it was these changes, especially extra xanthan gum, that made them more flexible and easier to make them thin, or rolling them between pieces of plastic, I don't know.

Now that I've had it, I can tell you there aren't enough stars to rate this highly enough.  If I had to choose between this cake and a regular chocolate cake made with wheat flour, I would choose this one hands down, no contest--!!!  This is one fantastic cake recipe.  The texture is moist and dense and lusciously chocolate (it reminds me a little of the \"Tasty Cake\" cupcakes I grew up with, but even better), very \"brownie-ish\" for those brownie addicts among us.  I think you can sub some of the flour varieties out pretty easily, especially the starchy ones like tapioca (I substituted potato starch for that one, since tapioca is made from yuca root, which is used like a potato in Central & South America).  The recipe came together easily and pretty quickly.  We do not even use a topping on this cake, as it is irresistible just as it is (however, for my grandson's special day we used a Cool Whip frosting made with chocolate pudding and a little less milk than the recipe called for).  To be honest, we just weren't counting on everyone's wanting seconds and thirds the way they did!!  We are not big on keeping sweets around the house, but I will admit we had to make this one again the next day for those who \"didn't get enough\" the first time around (it is awesome cold out of the refrig as well--had to cut it into bite-size \"guiltless\" chunks to keep it from disappearing within the hour).

My grocery store did not have ripened anaheim chilies (red) so I used the green anaheim chilies instead. I also cut the recipe in half as it's just 3 of us & depending on how hot it is, it may be just me eating it. lol It's currently in a jar in the refrigerator but was super easy to make (I never would have thought it was!) & the house smelled amazing. The entire place smelled like peppers while the mixture was cooling on the stove. I taste-tested the sauce after straining last night & it's not as fiery hot as I'd expected, the vinegar & salt are quite pronounced.

It's been 2 weeks & 2 days in the fridge & the flavor is spicy hot without the salt/vinegar flavors that were so prominent when first made.  The surprising (& maybe strange) thing is that if I were blindfolded & asked what kind of pepper was in this recipe I would tell you without a doubt that it's jalapeno.  But there is no jalapeno in the recipe at all.  When I taste-tested this (with just a finger) two days ago, I knew that it was going to be way too hot for my boys to eat.  So I had to wait til today when DS was out all day with friends & DH was planning on making (gag) frozen pizza for lunch.  lol  So today I enjoyed a ham & cheese-filled tortilla with sour cream and raspberry/chipotle salsa on the side.  As my toddler would say (a la Barney), \"Super-dee-duper!\"  I can't wait to try this with the red peppers too.  DH even looked for them at the store for me.

I combined with my whole bag of frozen stir fry veggies, added the chicken broth (mixed with cornstarch) and cooked for a few min.I was surprised how rich, fragrant and deeply colored my sauce turned out. I served mine over brown rice and chow mein noodles and for the rest of the family over spaghetti. It made for a really attractive lo mein. I will make this recipe again and again!

Goya tends to be a bit thinner and cheaper. I used Goya. (3.) Because this is in a crock pot, the sauce doesn't reduce much. It'll be a bit thinner than the stuff you get in restaurants. Maybe if I used the thicker coconut milk, the sauce would have been thicker. (4.) As a previous commenter noted, don't be shy with the salt. You probably need at least half a teaspoon.

I followed that with a light layer of shredded cheese, then the cornbread part, followed by a bit more cheese. I changed the cornbread part just a bit: using whole wheat flour and 3 egg whites. I took the milk option but also added a bit of powdered milk to the dry ingredients to enrich it. I baked it for about 35 minutes, which I think was just about right (I had thinner cornbread stuff, but more moisture, than would be in the regular recipe). To my immense surprise and delight, the whole thing worked really well. The little bit of cheese on top made a tasty, slightly baked-cheese-flavored crust. The flavor of the cornbread is just great, and it was moist and had a nice texture. I'm not using stars since I made so many changes, but this is obviously a really solid recipe.

Both my partner and I loved them.  The Pimenta de la Vera is critical to the taste of these burgers.  I found some a few months ago at a specialty market and love to use it on pork chops and chicken.  It has an intense smoky flavor.  I didn't bother with making the making the lemon-saffron mayo or the piquillo peppers.  The burgers with the grilled onions and manchego cheese were tasty enough without.  This is the first time we'd had manchego cheese.  It's a \"mature soft cheese\" that is creamy in texture with a nice tang.  On a side note, it's interesting that the Eating Well calorie calculation is 364 calories compared to what 'Zaar shows here at 549. http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/spanish_pork_burgers.html I am inclined to believe Eating Well.

This will now replace my tried and true recipe that I have used for 40 years.

I cooked this in a 2-quart size glass batter bowl with a handle and pouring spout and it worked perfectly. I used 1 1/2 cups of peanuts because we like lots of peanuts in our brittle. It took about 13 minutes to cook in a 1000 watt microwave (probably took longer because of adding more nuts). I have found that the secret to very thin brittle is to stir the soda in very quickly and pour the mixture out onto the pan while it is still actively foaming, spread it out and then lift the edges and stretch even thinner. I spray my utensils with non-stick cooking spray, as well as my pan and the spout of my batter bowl so it slides right out.

The first time, I used the Gold Medal flour I had around and the rolls were met with much pleasure. Fresh baked breads and rolls are always special, so that wasn't too hard to accomplish, the smell alone is enough to make one drool. This time I used King Arthur's All Purpose Flour, which is standardized and not prone to regional fluctuations in content. Although it is higher in protein somewhat and very well suited to yeast bread making, it produced  very light and fluffy Buttery Yeast Rolls, with just a slight chew to the outside to give them a little substance without overtaking the lightness at all. I don't use a bread machine, but the Kitchen Aid mixer with a dough hook attached, to mix and knead the dough. First, I heat the milk and water together until it's very warm, a bit warmer than the \"baby bath\" test, more of a \"tired mommy bath\" temp. I combine the liquid with the yeast and sugar in the bowl and allow the yeast to get it's job started and get activated. Add the egg, at room temp or warmer, the butter that is slightly melted, and the salt, but don't bother to stir. The flour is then unceremoniously dumped into the bowl and the mixer is started on low speed, to allow the flour to slowly combine into the liquids. I allow it to knead the dough until I see it is looking very elastic and stretchy. The dough is on the sticky side but improves after the first rising, which I do in a greased bowl in the warming drawer of the oven. It doesn't take long that way. After it is risen, I roll small balls out of the dough and place them in a greased 11x7 pan, spray the tops with non-stick cooking spray, cover with a towel and put back into the warming oven. Using this size pan seems to be about ideal, a little room for the rolls to spread out, but some force to make them rise upwards. This is a very easy easy, uncomplicated recipe that even a totally inexperienced bread baker shouldn't have too much trouble with and will convince the masses you are a master baker.

I cooked the rest at a lower temperature one batch at a time and made the roux in single-recipe batches... very nice.

I took it to our neighbor's tonight for Thanksgiving and my only regret was that I hadn't made more! :D I made a few changes, due to personal preference, as follows: I ran the Oreos through the food processor til they were finely crumbed, patted them into the pan and then firmly pressed them in place. I omitted the butter completely, feeling there was more than enough fat in the ground Oreos to compensate. While I was okay with how that change turned out, next time I'll probably add about 1/4 cup of melted butter to the food processor after the cookies are crumbed. If you don't mind that there are extra crumbs on the bottom of the pan...just omit the butter and sprinkle some extra crumbs on each plate as a \"garnish\" (see my photo). I baked the crust in a 325 F. oven for 6 minutes, then pulled it out and let it cool completely. Before I spread the cream cheese filling I put blobs of it evenly around the pan to minimize the \"drag\" on the crumbs, then gently spread it with a cake spatula (used for frosting cakes...worth getting!), though a table knife should suffice. I didn't have time to let it sit overnight, but due to the fine crumb of the Oreos, I didn't really need to do so. I refrigerated it for approximately 2 hours before we ate, and the taste and texture were more than acceptable. Also, I used Jello Chocolate Fudge flavor for the filling. Overall, this is an excellent choice for dessert. Did I mention that next week I'm passing the recipe on, per request, to two different dinner attendees? Thanks, Kathy, for a great recipe!

The problem may be in making the roux, which is the carefully cooked, equal quantities of flour and butter. You must begin with low heat and the mixture must be stirred constantly to avoid scorching the flour. Start by melting the butter over low heat. When the foaming begins to subside, add the flour (do not include the salt and pepper yet) and stir constantly, watching the color of the mixture. It should become a light, nutty brown color. This may take five minutes or so. Do not go by the clock, but rather by the color. If the process is stopped too soon, while still white, it will taste like raw flour. If it gets too brown, the flour has scorched and it will taste burnt. As soon as the color is right, slowly add the room-temperature milk/cream in increments, continuing to stir constantly. When all of the milk has been added, turn the heat up to medium high and continue stirring until it begins to bubble, then reduce heat to a simmer and and continue stirring until it thickens. You now have the basic white sauce, b\u00e9chamel, upon which many other cream sauces are built. In this recipe, that is a cheese sauce.

(2) Let the batter sit for about 10 to 15 minutes before baking, in order to let it become more glutenous so it won't crumble when done baking.  (3) Bake it in a cast iron skillet:  First, preheat the cast iron skillet in the oven.  When the oven is done preheating, it's time to add the batter.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't use water as an ingredient for the base (as I thought the flavor would be lacking) and this fit the bill.  I also added about 1 TBS of minced garlic when I sauteed the potatoes, celery, carrots etc. I also sliced the carrots (I sliced in half the larger slices) and celery instead of dicing them, as I like the heartiness this lends to the soup.  I used chopped canned clams (because fresh sounded like a lot of work and I am cheap).

Reading the other reviews, I would suggest using at least another cup of Manioc starch, and if you can find it (you can find anything on the internet) get sour Manioc starch, For one, it's more authentic and for another, it tastes better IMHO. \r\n\r\nAlso a good trick is to only use 1/2 parmesan cheese and 1/2 another white cheese with more moisture.

I can't believe I actually made this in my own kitchen! Absolutely incredible!

For now, I'll keep and review it without the buttermilk, and next time I will make it with. I don't see how I could go wrong! All I can say is WOW!!

I've made it three times in 10 days...maybe the newness will wear off, but we can't get enough of it...we've been eating salad for late night snacks, just to enjoy!  Super if you're doing low-carb!\n\nHere's what I used:\nHellman's Reduced Fat Mayo\nBreakstone's Reduced Fat Sour Cream\n\nYou would NEVER know it was reduced fat.  We had company and I felt compelled to tell them it was reduced fat so that they could enjoy it all the more.\n\nThe reason I've mentioned brands, is because I think mayos/salad dressings and even sour cream brands can vary so much...thought it might be helpful to know what was successful for us.  For Worcestershire sauce, we used Lea Perrins 2 times, and a generic once, and noticed nothing different. We used fresh squeezed lemon.\n\nAs written, the recipe is thick like pudding, or dip.  In fact, this would make a great base for making different dips. But for this recipe, I actually used as much as 1 and 1/2 cups of buttermilk when all was said and done, as we like our dressing to be slightly pourable rather than gloppy...and it's still extremely thick with all the buttermilk I put in.  So feel free to add buttermilk to any consistency you prefer, you will not diminish taste at all.  AND, it thickens more in the fridge.\n\nI was dubious about the qty of sugar, but I used Splenda equal to 1 1/2 tsp the first time and let sit overnight.  The next morning decided to go ahead with the last 1/2 tsp of sugar and I liked it even better.  It's not a \"sweet\" dressing even with that amt.  The 2nd two times I made the recipe, I used agave nectar equal to the 2 tsp sugar.  (U need less agave nectar and it's lo glycemic.) \n\nThe 1st & 2nd time I made the recipe there was an underbite that was bothering me...not heat or spice, just something a bit too sharp that didn't mellow overnight, and left a bit of aftertaste after dinner.    I think it may have been the fresh grated onion, as mine may have been very strong, or perhaps the garlic.  I'm not sure.  The 3rd time I made the recipe, I used 1 tsp of onion powder and no fresh minced garlic.  I cut the white pepper to a scant 1/2 tsp, as white pepper can be sharp.  That unpleasant bite was gone in the 3rd version with no  loss of flavor whatsoever.  For ease, the onion powder was helpful, as grating part of an onion was just a slight pain, although I probably don't have the best grater for that.  Mostly, because the onions I get seem to be inconsistent, I think I'll use onion powder in the future.  \nAll the other ingredients, I did just as written, including the tabasco and cayenne.  It's not spicy.  We love spice, but with blue cheese dressing, just a bit of tang is all most people want, I'd think.  \n\nI highly recommend Rosenberg's Danish Blue Cheese.  Only problem is, it comes in 4.5 oz containers...but get 2 and put them both in...it's even better with more cheese!  To me, that's the nice thing about making it yourself.  Some bottled ones are SO chintzy on the cheese.  If we're going to bother making it, it's nice to have it just a bit over the top!  Enjoy! \nLuby,  I'm sure we'll be making this for the rest of our lives!", "calories": "206.7", "saturatedFatContent": "7.0", "cookTime": "0 mins", "sodiumContent": "558.7", "fiberContent": "0.0", "servings": "10 ", "date": "March 04, 2003", "sugarContent": "4.0", "proteinContent": "4.8", "fatContent": "17.4", "prepTime": "15 mins"}, {"category": ["One Dish meal", "Main dish", "Salmon"], "carbohydrateContent": "3.5", "cholesterolContent": "23.8", "review_date": "January 24, 2010", "name": "Grilled Salmon With Vegetables", "review": "This was very good; gourmet restaurant quality.

This seriously is not only the most delicious fish I've ever made, but the best I've ever tasted--and I eat a lot of seafood!  I did use fresh tilapia that was just caught today, so I think I have to attribute a portion of it to that.  The crust was perfect and crispy, and so flavorful, but did not overshadow the delicate fish, which was so tender it was actually creamy.  Unbelievable!  My 9 year old wants me to make it again tomorrow!  I did alter it a bit simply because I was cutting it down to two fillets and made a couple of mistakes!  I cut everything in half, but accidentally added 2 Tbsp of lemon juice anyway . . . and I did double the ratio of Old Bay but (again accidentally, my head not on today!) added that to the butter instead, so I then threw a little more in with the panko.  I used butter, not margarine (a no brainer in my mind).  Lastly, I dredged it in Wondra flour first before dipping in the butter, which I believe gives a nicer crust.  At the end, I drizzled on some of the leftover butter mix and then sprinkled on some extra crumbs where it looked like they didn't stick.  Baked at 400 for 10 minutes.  Perfecto!!!

Once they were all in the pan, I pressed brown sugar on the top of each one- the fat from the partially cooked bacon made it easy to adhere.  Last step was a good sprinkling of Tony Chachere's seasoning on each.  I put them in the oven at 250 degrees for 1 hour, then raised the heat to 350 until the bacon was crispy and they were obviously done, about another 30 minutes or so in my oven.

We've made these at least once a week for the last year.  We often make a double batch on the weekend and freeze some for quick use over the week (just pop them straight in the toaster and they are ready to go).  For the freezer batch, we just do not let them crisp as much as the ones we are going to eat that day. We've have tried MANY variations based on what we have on hand and have learned a few tricks when preparing them.  DO NOT USE A MIXER to mix these if you want them light and crispy.  For the first 2 months I would use the kitchen aid to whip up the egg whites, mix everything else separately and fold in the eggs but was unable to get them light and crisp (though the batter did go further).  For the next 8 months we tried to mix everything in the mixer and still found that they weren't as light and fluffy as we like them. And then one day the mixer was in use and I had to mix them by hand and they came out PERFECT!  They were totally light and fluffy (though they only made 8 waffles and not 10 like they could make before).  The last time I made these, we were out of eggs so we used egg replacer and found that they were even lighter and tasted better by our standards!  We've made variations with soy milk, whole milk, skim milk, goats milk and buttermilk, but feel that buttermilk is the way to go for us.

I also must admit that I upped the amount of cream to a full cup (I had a huge carton in the fridge I needed to use plus I just love cream).  I also used my cheap hand held emersion blender to smooth it out a little -- not completely smooth -- still like some texture.  Thanks for sharing.

First of all, I didn't have any bell pepper.  I only had 1 can tomato sauce.  I used the stewed tomatoes, pinto, kidney, and ranch style beans.  I also used diced tomatoes, but didn't have Rotel.  I searched my cabinet to see what I could use for more tomato sauce, and saw some \"no name beans in tomato sauce\" that someone from Canada left here a couple years ago, so threw them in.  (They were more like Pork and Beans, without the pork).   I also didn't have any chili seasoning, so I used a package of taco seasoning.  I added 2 tablespoons of chili powder in hopes of making it taste somewhat like chili.  I started it cooking on top of the stove, but, my pan kept burning, even though I added more liquid.  I put it into the crock pot and decided to taste it at this point.  Ate a small bowl,  it was good!  I cooked it in the crock pot for less than an hour while I made cornbread.

I baked for the full 50 minutes although that also seemed pretty long?  Overall we didn't think this was worth the wait, it wasn't really to our tastes.  However I'm sure some people would like it.

I have no idea what I'm doing, so I find recipes on Recipezaar with high ratings, scour the comments for hints and say a little prayer before any attempts in the kitchen. While these potatoes are delicious, I thought I would share what I learned in case there is anyone as desperately in need of help in the kitchen as me.\n\nFirst, I bought a mandolin specifically for this recipe, and I'm glad I did. Saved me A LOT of time. However, in putting half the potatoes in, I didn't separate them carefully enough... so in some cases, it was as though the slices were three times what they ought to have been.  DUH. Next time, I will take the time and care to lay the potatoes out in a single layer with a tiny bit of sauce alternating each layer to keep them from sticking together and not cooking thoroughly.\n\nNext, I made this recipe the day before because I've heard they taste better the second day. The first day, I tasted them and was worried that in putting the amount of salt called for in the recipe in that I had over-salted and ruined them.  But the next day, they weren't salty at all - they were perfect. (I cooked them the full hour; the next day, let them come to room temperature for an hour and then re-heated them at 350 for 30 minutes. Due to my not separating the slices enough, some of the potatoes were STILL not quite done.) But if I were to plan to eat them the same day, I would cut way down on the salt.\n\nHope no one needs as much help in the kitchen as me (if they do, they probably need another adult to watch them to ensure they don't end up killing themselves in a tragic vegetable-peeler-incident), but if so, hope this was helpful.

I don't think it was really my changes of ingredients but my change of rolling technique that made the difference:  I cut a large Ziplock bag in half down the sides, so it opened out flat, then put the dough between the halves to roll it.  I did not use any extra flour to roll them.  About half way through, I had to cut a new bag, because the one I was using was beginning to stick. I didn't bother cutting circles, because I was working very quickly.  Between the pieces of plastic, I was able to get the pieces very thin, and I think that made all the difference.  For the record, however, the ingredient changes were:  white rice flour instead of brown which I had used the first time (the recipe doesn't specify), Bob's Red Mill baking mix instead of chickpea flour (just the closest thing I had on hand), all tapioca flour instead of tapioca and potato starch (I used up my potato starch making gluten, egg, and corn free marshmallows) 1 1/2 tsp xanthan gum and no guar gum (don't have any, and I thought it needed more than the original recipe called for, to prevent breaking and make them more flexible), and regular butter (don't have coconut butter, and didn't want olive oil).  Whether it was these changes, especially extra xanthan gum, that made them more flexible and easier to make them thin, or rolling them between pieces of plastic, I don't know.  But, for any curious readers, there they are.\n\nAfter dinner, I took the leftovers and froze them between layers of wax paper.  I did this also with the last recipe, and they kept well.

I bought fresh minced clams (in their juice) and used half and half. After I browned 4 slices of Oscar Mayer bacon and a whole vidalia onion (chopped); I added two cans of cream of celery soup, two cans of half and half and all of the clam juice to make a broth. Separately, I boiled potatoes, and acknowledging the other reviews, I only peeled and cut up two potatoes so as not to make it too potato-ey. I reserved the fresh minced clams until the end so that they would not get overcooked and rubbery (thanks for that tip too!). The stock seemed a little thin, so I added two tablespoons of Idahoan instant buttery potato, sprinkling it in the broth and letting it dissolve. It thickened the broth and the taste was wonderful--flavor from the soup stock, half and half and clam juice--plus richness from the instant potatoes. I added half a stick of butter to the bacon when it was cooked before I put the onions in too. Now, the chowder is just simmering under a boil--stirring so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the Le Creuset pot--adding the clams last and letting them heat through for flavor but not overcooking them is the last step. Coarse pepper ground on top. I bought two pumpernickel bagels at the farmer's market and will toast them and spread cream cheese on top to go with this hearty chowder for our supper by the New England coast.

They have such a nice flavor and although they are not \"spicey\" they have a nice delicate flavor that is well rounded.  I put them over tricolor radiatore pasta.  My little girl loves Swedish meatballs so I made these as a surprise for her.  She really loved them.  I used a slightly different gravy because I needed alot of it since I was putting them over pasta.  I made just one change to the meatballs- I had to add more meat.  There was too much liquid for this small amount of meat.  It was still really squishy and wet after the chill time so I added meat a quarter pound at a time until I thought they were about right.  I ended up adding another whole pound of meat and they were still very soft but I left them that way because the recipe says they are supposed to be very soft.  All the other ingredients I left as written in the recipe.  For the gravy, I cooked 3 tablespoons of butter with 4 tablespoons of flour until browned and then added 2 cups of light cream, the pan juices, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp white pepper and 1 teaspoon of beef base.  It was absolutely perfect and complimented your meatballs perefectly!  The gravy did not over power the delicate flavor of the meatballs.  I also resisted my urge to add garlic.  Being Italian, I just want to add garlic to everything and I think it does not belong here so I held my garlic hand back! :)  I ended up with 51 of these little cuties.

I added everything into my food processor (first the crab meat-processed-then the onions-processed-then the remaining incredients-processed unitl it was a good consistency -small pieces but not chunky) and I removed it from the food processor once everything was processed and combined together and I filled the mushroom caps with the filling heaping.  I drizzled the butter and made sure that the pan had a little olive oil greased on the bottom of it as well.  Turned out wonderful!

They looked like jalebis but unfortunately did not quite taste like the authentic ones. Also, after putting them in the syrup, they turned limp within seconds. This does not happen when I use fermented batter. I followed the recipe exactly as you stated. Do yours come out like the ones available in the market? Perhaps, I needed to ferment the batter, after all? I will make them again but the next time, I will add less water and more yogurt. Watch this space...I'll come back and tell you how it turned out!! UPDATE : And I'm back! About 36 hours later, I made some more jalebis out of the left over batter. And this time they were perfect!!! They were crisp and yummy, with a hint of the fermentation taste, and my husband loved it! Hmmm, so the batter did need to ferment....:) After having sampled today's lot, your recipe definitely rates a 4 star and not the 3 that I gave you earlier!! Sorry about that, but at that time, it just didn't taste right:( But now I'm going to be making it often....just will let the batter sit for atleast 5 hours before I make the jalebis.
