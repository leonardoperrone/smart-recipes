I love thai yellow curry and have been wanting to make it at home... I was just looking for the right recipe.  This one is VERY good, very authentic.  It has just the right amount of spices.  I halved the recipe and used potatoes, carrots, and yellow onion for my vegetables.  If you don't have the fish sauce, I think you could leave it out without affecting the flavor.  I did not taste it all in the end.  I also added some red pepper flakes in the final simmer for an additional heat.  It was great.  I could barely eat it fast enough! hahaha...

My immediate reaction to the recipe is that only 2 Tbsp of cocoa wouldn't be especially chocolatey in a whole pie, but I faithfully followed the recipe.

Between eight and nine minutes, it suddenly got quite thick, but was still fluid enough to scrape into the pie crust with a rubber spatula.\r\n\r\nI've just finished the last piece, and have to say that my initial suspicions were verified.  I believe the pie was more sugary sweet than it was chocolately.  Poking around on the web, it seems that other similar recipes use substantially more cocoa.

I'm an old-fashioned polentum, and the idea of \"creamy polenta\" sets my teeth on edge. This recipe is very well written. Just a couple of thoughts -- I use less water, about 3 1/4 cups per cup of polenta, and less salt, about 1/2 tablespoon per cup of polenta. The trickiest part of cooking polenta is avoiding the formation of lumps: stay away from instant polenta, heat the water so that the surface is barely shivering when you pour it in, and stir rapidly when pouring it in. Once you try it, you'll understand what \"pull away from the sides of the pot\" means. That is an accurate description. I usually halve the recipe for the 2 of us, and the polenta cooks up in about 20 minutes. I use a stainless steel pot (my Grandma used a huge copper kettle on a wood-burning stove); after cooking and pouring out, the film in the pot will come off easily once soaked in cold water. For a nice presentation lightly oil a loaf pan and pour the polenta into it immediately after cooking and cover with foil. It will stay warm for a long time, firm up, and then can be unmolded on a serving platter.

And, I have him trained to tell me his honest opinion about my cooking. He raved about this chicken. He just kept saying \"man this is good.\" And, I agree the taste is spectacular. During baking I turned each chicken piece a few times. They got cripsy and very moist and tasty.

Depending on what I have on hand and my mom's taste and needs, I usually add walnuts, almonds, cashews, macadamia nuts, pumpkin seeds, dried fruit, hemp seeds, carob, almond butter, spirulina, sesame seeds or any combination of the above.  I also add ginger if a mom has slow letdown, but only if she didn't have significant blood loss after the birth since ginger is a natural blood thinner.  If it's been a few weeks since she gave birth and her bleeding has stopped, ginger is fine.  I have added fenugreek to the recipe as well, but only if the mom is having serious supply issues.  Otherwise, I recommend fenugreek tea since it's milder and easier to control the amount you consume.  I've even made them vegan by using Ener-G and vegan margarine and shortening.

I followed the recipe to a T. (Well, OK, I have to fess up that I did add several drops of chipotle Tabasco to the sauce recipe). The flavours of the spices were very noticeable and distinct, while not being overpowering. A couple of comments, though: first, even though I filled each tortilla with over 1/4 cup of the cheese/onion mixture, I got 16 enchiladas and still had almost 1/2 pound of the cheese mixture left over - it did NOT go to waste however as I sprinkled it over the top of the enchiladas right before baking and the result was a fantastic bubbly gooey cheese topping. Second, while the sauce was absolutely delicious, there was insufficient liquid to smother the enchiladas in the baking dish because the liquid had reduced quite a bit during the simmering process, and so I had to make about another cup and a half of the sauce (without adding any more meat) and that worked out just fine. I will certainly use the sauce part of this recipe again for another purpose, namely to use it in my own \"Sunken Meat Burritos\" recipe.

Added cornstarch to some of the stock, to thicken.  Next time, will add chunks of onion and sweet potato.  Husband added more cayenne and curry at the table; he is more highly evolved than I am.  Used organic peanut butter (no additives) so threw in a scant teaspoon of sugar to compensate.  Reduced the butter/oil amounts, also.

I didn't have coffee so I used 1T Nestle's chocolate milk syrup and 1/2 c minus 1T skim milk. The donuts were cakey and a little spongy. I thought that the slightly spongy texture might be due to the milk. But my family had no problems with that. I also couldn't find my donut pan and used a mini bundt pan instead. They looked kind of fancy. I put in about 1/4 batter and got 10 donuts. I cooked them for 10 minutes. I wasn't sure of the glaze because I only used 1T water and it was pretty thin. But it fine, it made a nice little crust on the donuts, just like the ones from a donut place. As far as points go I figured them to be 5 pts each. Thanks for a great recipe.

I wasn't sure if I was to cook the bacon in the same pan as I had cooked the sausage or if I should drain off the fat of each.  I decided to cook the sausage in one pan and the bacon/onion in another.  I drained fat off both.  If I use bacon next time, I will cook it first and then cook the onions and garlic after it is done in the bacon grease.

When I asked for it at the food store they thought I was asking for that fruity tea drink, Snapple...lol.  Well, to make a long story short we raised a pig this summer, had her butchered early this fall and last week took two days to make the scrapple. The butcher saved me scraps and the liver, sans head.  Afterwards I had three stock pots going and all edible meat was ground up with my Kithchen Aid meat grinder.  I tweaked the seasonings and used barley flour instead of the buckwheat flour along with the cornmeal.  The end result was 10lbs of \"my own recipe\" for scrapple.  I have enough scraps to make another batch , but will have to purchase the liver.  I think that will keeps us until next fall when the summer feeder pig go to butcher.

I stuck the truffles in the freezer after step 4 for about 30 minutes (while I played outside with my puppy), and I think it helped the dipping go easier.

My taste buds are cheering.  Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  Cooks up similar to my rice pudding recipe which I can leave unattended for most of the cooking time.  My son, who had never had Indian Pudding, raved about it.  My husband, who like me, hasn't had it in years, loved it, too.  I'm surprised no one has reviewed this recipe until now.

The crust was good, the meringue lovely (I used all 6 egg whites and adjusted the sugar etc to compensate).  The problem was with the ingredients and method of making the filling, I think.  I have only made LMP a few times and always used a recipe that had a lemon curd type of filling.  Never a problem with runny filling or flavourless filling.  Due to the rave reviews I thought I'd try this to see what I was missing.  My first question was about adding so much water to the filling ingredients.  I noticed many LMP recipes use a water and cornstarch based filling which seems to provide much less flavour than one using mostly or all lemon juice for the filling.  I also didn't understand adding unbeaten egg yolks to all that sugar and cornstarch.  That seems like asking for trouble along the lines of little bits of tough egg floating in the filling.  Why not combine the water and beaten egg yolks or even a little water and egg yolks?  Or add some of the cold water to the sugar and cornstarch, then add the rest to the yolks and combine?  It would prevent egg lumps that one reviewer said she dealt with by using an immersion blender.  Then the cooking instructions seem backwards.  They say to cook the sugar, cornstarch, yolks and water \"until thickened\", then add the lemon juice, rind and butter.  I did cook the sugar mixture until very thick (like icing or heavy  custard) but once I added the juice and the butter it became pourable and never thickened up again.  The pie has been in the fridge for 24 hours and the filling is still the consistency of melted ice cream.  Why not cook the filling with the butter and lemon juice in it so you can accurately judge the consistency?  Did I cook it too long?  Not long enough?  There is no real way to know.  The taste is okay but not special even using fresh lemon juice, sweeter today than yesterday we all agreed, and the meringue did not weep at all.  It looked lovely until we cut it and it poured itself out of its crust.  IMHO, just not worth the effort given the ease by which one can make a real lemon curd for such a pie and avoid the issue of \"will it or wont it\" thicken.", "calories": "476.3", "saturatedFatContent": "10.4", "cookTime": "55 mins", "sodiumContent": "245.0", "fiberContent": "0.8", "servings": "1 ", "date": "June 05, 2003", "sugarContent": "41.3", "proteinContent": "6.4", "fatContent": "22.0", "prepTime": "45 mins"}, {"category": ["Pies", "Pies and tarts", "Dessert"], "carbohydrateContent": "64.4", "cholesterolContent": "168.8", "review_date": "May 29, 2010", "name": "The Ultimate Lemon Meringue Pie", "review": "My mother has always wished for her mother's lemon pie, but she passed away before she ever knew the secret of her pie.

You can use any kind of beef, such as chuck, sirloin, or fresh brisket, not an expensive cut.  Wash it in cold water, put in pot big enough so that it can be covered with cold water, add 1 box of un-iodized salt, cover, put in refrigerator for 3 days.  Turn a couple times during three days. (72 hrs. is sufficient, but, a few more or less won't matter.)  Meat will be grayish in color, but, this in no way affects the flavor. On cooking day, rinse off salt, put in pot and cover with fresh cold water.  Bring to boil, then, lower heat to a simmer.  No spices are added, just all the veggies incl. onions, taters, cabbage, turnip,and, maybe a parsnip or two, after the meat is fork tender. At this point, I remove the meat from pot, cover with foil, and put aside, then add the veggies. The only thing we ever drank with it was beer, and it's one of our very favorite dishes.

However on the second batch of cookie dough I did a little tinkering.  The first batch I followed the recipe to the letter, but I think there is an issue of word usage in the directions.  It says after adding the last bit of the dry ingredients to mix until dough is smooth.  This dough will not be smooth but more like pie crust, so make sure you mix until well incorporated.  It will be pretty much a heavy chunk of heavenly smelling dough that can easily divided to chill.  Also with as much ginger this recipe calls for, keep in mind even after baking these cookies will have a strong ginger flavor which is great for gingerbread cookie lovers like myself, but be prepared for the non-fans.  A nice coating of Royal Icing can help in this regaurd, or the traditional raisins.  My second batch I reduced the amount of flour to 2 1/2 cups, and reduced the ginger by half.  Since gingerbread is used for cut out cookies there is the risk of the dough becoming tough using the dusting of flour to keep it from sticking.  There is already quite a bit of flour in the dough itself so you will need even less flour dusting than say with sugar cookie dough, however after repeated dusting and handling, reducing the cooking time won't help having a rather hard cookie after cooling.  Using a half cup less flour there is room for dusting and handling no problem, but make sure you chill at the very least 3-4 hours and keep dough you're not using in the frige.  Reducing the amount of ginger by half gives the cookie a more mild ginger flavor which appeals to children far better as well as those finicky \"big kids\" who want a more sweet cookie.

I have added various herbs at times, and have also added various cheeses.  Cheddar (mild) is my fav.  You also do not have to \"pour butter\" on top, or even add it to the mix.  I don't add any oil, but I DO dot the top of the bread with pieces of butter.  I do not sift the flour and it comes out fine, but I just spoon the flour into a measuring cup.  The trick is, do NOT mix a lot, just lightly mix until you have pretty much coated all the flour in the bowl, but no more!  Overmixing will give you a hard loaf.  If you see a little bit of flour in the bowl, or when you put it in the pan, it is fine...do NOT overmix!  I just \"turn it\" into a buttered loaf pan, and then I take the spoon and  gently \"push\" the dough around to make sure it is evenly distributed, especially in the corners...do NOT make it completely level, or push down on it to spread evenly; just light pushing is all you need.  It will look lumpy on top...that's better.  Then just dot with butter, as much or as little as you want.  I also cook it at 350, not 375...you can even use 325 if your oven seems to bake on the hot side.  I usually cook it for an hour, but as soon as it is lightly browned on top, I take it out.  Sometimes, that is after 55 min., sometimes 1 hour...don't cook longer than an hour, unless you have it on 325 and it is not browned at all.  If it is lightly browned and when you push on the top with your finger it seems firm, take it out...1 hour should be sufficient.  I let it sit in the pan for just a minute, then I turn it out, and let the loaf lay on it's side on some paper towels.  You MUST let it cool, at least 20 minutes, or when you cut it, it will be a gummy mess!  It should be cool enough to where you can comfortably hold the loaf with your hand while cutting...if it is too hot to hold, then it is not cool enough.  I wait until it is slightly warm, and then cut it...when it is completely cooled, it is fine as well.  As I mentioned, it does taste more like \"beer\" if you add no sugar, but you do not need it, or any sweetner at all...it will still come out just fine...children would probably like it with some sweetner.  Good luck and enjoy!  I make it every weekend, as it is quick, and I always have the ingredients on hand....Also, DON'T USE EXPIRED Self-Rising flour, or EXPIRED baking powder!!!  I also use ROOM TEMPERATURE BEER, NOT REFRIGERATED!  Open the beer, and then pour it into the flour right away, and just stir until coated, NO MORE...DO NOT OVERWORK, VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!  Sifting the flour would probably help as well, but I don't...just remember, if you don't sift it, DO NOT PACK IT INTO THE MEASURING CUP!  Just spoon it in lightly.  Don't be afraid to experiment with different ingredients!

The crust layer baked up quite well in my microwave oven.

I just let them cool, sprinkled the top with powdered sugar, and they were every bit the luscious lemony treat this classic recipe is known to be.

However, I did have some problems with the method and I don't know if this may be due to a difference in microwave wattage or what the problem was. My micro is 700W. In step #1, there is no power level specified, so I assumed \"high\". The crust started to lightly brown in some spots which seemed to be ok. Then I proceeded with the recipe and  the lemon filling bubbled up so much I thought it would overflow the 8\" square pan. In step #3, the directions say to cook on high unil the center begins to set but it never looked like it was setting to me even after adding another 45 seconds. The filling continued to look wet, sticky and foamy (from the eggs). So I decided to finish it in the oven and baked it at 350 for 8 minutes and then it set very nicely. The bars tasted good, but the texture was chewy on some bars, rock hard on other bars. So, the next day I repeated the recipe using the oven instead - Baked the crust alone at 350 for 15 minutes, then added the filling and continued to bake for 20 minutes. They were fabulous, my family loved them and they disappeared in one day. The photograph is from the second attempt. As I said, it could be the difference in the wattage of the microwave, or maybe I blew it in step #1 by assuming a high power. I would absolutely make these again, but would just use the oven method.

I was at Sam's Club the other day too, and I checked a bag of quinoa they sell there (also organic), and it said it had been rinsed as well. I don't rinse before I cook my Bob's RM, and it always tastes great. Maybe it's just the organic ones that rinse it first before selling it in stores. I don't know. Regardless, I do still plan to try your method of toasting, to add another depth of flavor to the quinoa. UPDATE 12/7/10: I was looking for a way to jazz up my quinoa, and I came back across this recipe/method. WOW, does it ever change the texture and flavor for the better! My quinoa started to smell like, hmm... popcorn-y almost, and I was worried I overtoasted it, but it came out really good.

I have added various herbs at times, and have also added various cheeses.  Cheddar (mild) is my fav.  You also do not have to \"pour butter\" on top, or even add it to the mix.  I don't add any oil, but I DO dot the top of the bread with pieces of butter.  I do not sift the flour and it comes out fine, but I just spoon the flour into a measuring cup.  The trick is, do NOT mix a lot, just lightly mix until you have pretty much coated all the flour in the bowl, but no more!  Overmixing will give you a hard loaf.  If you see a little bit of flour in the bowl, or when you put it in the pan, it is fine...do NOT overmix!  I just \"turn it\" into a buttered loaf pan, and then I take the spoon and  gently \"push\" the dough around to make sure it is evenly distributed, especially in the corners...do NOT make it completely level, or push down on it to spread evenly; just light pushing is all you need.  It will look lumpy on top...that's better.  Then just dot with butter, as much or as little as you want.  I also cook it at 350, not 375...you can even use 325 if your oven seems to bake on the hot side.  I usually cook it for an hour, but as soon as it is lightly browned on top, I take it out.  Sometimes, that is after 55 min., sometimes 1 hour...don't cook longer than an hour, unless you have it on 325 and it is not browned at all.  If it is lightly browned and when you push on the top with your finger it seems firm, take it out...1 hour should be sufficient.  I let it sit in the pan for just a minute, then I turn it out, and let the loaf lay on it's side on some paper towels.  You MUST let it cool, at least 20 minutes, or when you cut it, it will be a gummy mess!  It should be cool enough to where you can comfortably hold the loaf with your hand while cutting...if it is too hot to hold, then it is not cool enough.  I wait until it is slightly warm, and then cut it...when it is completely cooled, it is fine as well.  As I mentioned, it does taste more like \"beer\" if you add no sugar, but you do not need it, or any sweetner at all...it will still come out just fine...children would probably like it with some sweetner.  Good luck and enjoy!  I make it every weekend, as it is quick, and I always have the ingredients on hand....Also, DON'T USE EXPIRED Self-Rising flour, or EXPIRED baking powder!!!  I also use ROOM TEMPERATURE BEER, NOT REFRIGERATED!  Open the beer, and then pour it into the flour right away, and just stir until coated, NO MORE...DO NOT OVERWORK, VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!  Sifting the flour would probably help as well, but I don't...just remember, if you don't sift it, DO NOT PACK IT INTO THE MEASURING CUP!  Just spoon it in lightly.

I made it for our dinner tonight as I wanted to surprise mom and dad with a Zaar recipe!). I did cut down \"tremendously\" on the quantity of fat, though, in this. Instead of using 12 tbsps(6oz.) of ghee/butter, I used Just ONE Tbsp. of regular oil in it(Ghee and butter are both too fatening and I'm back to counting cals!). Trust me, 1 tbsp. was more than sufficient!!! Moreover, I did use fresh ginger(peeled and grated). Honestly, I felt this should NOT be an optional ingredient, but one that's required. I did use 2 medium tomatoes as well(Tomatoes again are necessary if you want authentic Indian masoor dal). I used 3 cups of masoor dal and 6+1/2+3/4 cups of water(divided). The first 6 cups I added as for step number 3. The remaining water I added when I reached step number 11. What I particularly liked was the slightly crispy taste of the onions as I did not over-fry them. They were just soft and light brown as per the recipe. This dal was RIGHTLY SPICED- Not too much, nor too less. It was just perfect! I think now that I have suggested how I cut down on the oil(fat), nobody who wants to try this recipe need worry about any extra cals:) I had this with white bread while mom and dad relished it with hot chappatis. I will try it with Anu's Tangy lemon rice next time(that's another one of my favourite recipes). Together with this recipe, the dal and lemon rice will make a marriage in food heaven - this I can GUARANTEE!

To say it went over well is an understatement. One person that managed to put in a bid for a slice the Sunday following just sat there and sorta moaned while eating. Upon inquiry with our normally rather formal and gracious guest, she stated she was great and having a \"cheesecake orgasm.\" Very difficult to reply to your guest when they say that, lol. A couple of points about preparing this, one, I used honey roasted peanuts in the crust. I found the peanut butter cups were best not cut too small but leaving some chunks worked well, about 1/8 of a full size cup or 1/4 of a mini. Adding the brown sugar is a bit of an issue though, as it tends to have small lumps or forms them when you blend it in. It is important you do not overmix the cheesecake batter, so as not to incorporate too much air, which could result in a nasty and unattractive crack in the cake. Next time I think I will blend the peanut butter, cream and brown sugar together seperately, and then add to the cheese mixture. Allow the batter to sit in it's mixing bowl for a few minutes and then sharply rap it against a counter to release some of those trapped air bubbles, which helps prevent cracking issues later. Once added to the pan, lightly shake and tap the pan to help release any last bubbles, but use care to not disturb the crust with rough handling. I am rather paranoid that water from the Bain Marie will seep into springform pans, so what I do is wrap the pan in several overlapping layers of aluminum foil and then place in a very heavy plastic bag, such as the heavy duty duty ones you get at some grocery stores, securing it to the side of the pan with a bit of handy duct tape. Don't worry, the bag will not burn nor melt at this baking temp, comes out good as new, scary thought, lol. When adding the hot water to the Bain Marie, try using very hot water that is nearly boiling, as this will help speed things along a bit, as I encountered a very prolonged cooking time with just hot tap water. Don't open the oven at all until it is truly getting close to the minimum baking time, as opening the oven provokes those dreaded cracks and slows down the baking as well. Allow for just a slight jiggle in the very center of the cake to let you know it's done with baking. Make at least a quantity and a half of the sour cream topping to make sure the top is smooth and evenly covered. Once the sour cream topping has set, DON'T REMOVE THE CHEESECAKE FROM THE OVEN. Turn off the oven and prop the oven door open slightly and leave it in there for at least an hour to allow it to very slowly cool down. Remove from oven and very gently loosen the crust from the side of the pan with a long and thin knife blade, using care not to disturb it too much. Doing this helps the crust to pull away from the pan as the cake contracts in cooling, putting less stress on the cheesecake, lessening the chance of a crack developing. Allow to cool thoroughly on a rack and then refrigerate, preferably wrapped in a kitchen towel to insulate it, so that it chills slowly. Feel free to make your cheesecake a couple of days ahead, it really does improve with a little age. When slicing your cheesecake, using a thin blade that you clean with a cool, wet towel in between EVERY slice, leaving a little moisture on the blade. This method gives you a cleaner slice of this almost heaven. I guilded the lily and plated this with homemade caramel and ganache sauces, along with some pb cup pieces and chopped honey roasted peanuts. All this sounds complicated, but in reality it takes very little actual active work, it's all pretty easy in the end and will convince people you are the Queen of Cheesecake. Btw, if you are just not able to go through the anti-crack steps, don't worry, heck with it, it will still taste awesome, even if a crack does develop. If this happens, just strategically cover any oops with pb cups, nuts and sauces, likely no one will notice and definitely won't care after they wrap their mouth around this lucious little number.

That is how good this cheesecake is.  It is amazing, decadent, delicious.  Think of the most delicious food adjectives available, and the apply them at your will to this recipe.  Sooooo good.  I made the cheesecake exactly according to the recipe's ingedients, and it turned out perfectly.  If I make it again, I will probably chop up fewer oreos because I found that after patting in the crust for my 10-inch cheesecake, I still had about 3/4 cup of leftover oreo crumbs.  Also, like others, I had to bake the cheesecake for a longer period of time--closer to 2 hours--to make sure that it set correctly.  After 2 hours, the middle was still a little jiggly and it looked perfect.  I thought the topping listed looked so-so, so I decided against that.  Instead, I spead some room-temperature store-bought hot fudge topping over the top, then topped that with about 8 chopped up reese's PB cups.  I also sprinkled some chopped peanuts on the top.  Then, to finish, I heated up some additional hot fudge in the microwave and drizzled it over the top and down the sides.  Doing all this was an extra step, but I made this cheesecake for the holidays so it turned out looking really festive and beautiful.  My husband thought he died and went to heaven.  Just a quick note: Do NOT attempt to make this cheesecake in a 9-inch pan.  You really need a 10-inch, or the 9-inch will overflow because there will be too much batter.

I have never had a turkey sandwich with\r\ncranberry sauce before, and now I know what I've been missing. I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, as I truly enjoyed it. When making the sandwich, I did however use, 3 slices of cooked bacon, 2 slices of provolone cheese, and I used a multi grain bread, (which I purchased at an Aldi's Grocery Store) plus I did not add the lettuce. The first time I made this sandwich, I\r\nadded a bit more butter to my skillet (1/2 a tablespoon per each side when grilling the sandwich) and the second time, I just carefully buttered the outside of both slices of bread, so no need to add butter to the skillet. I grilled mine over medium heat anywhere from 2 minutes & 30 seconds, to 3 minutes per each side. I don't know what Applebee's Turkey and Cranberry Sandwich tastes like, as I don't care to eat at Applebee's, but I bet this sandwich out beats the one on their menu.

I think this might be good in the right circumstances, but I had some problems. I think my main problem was that modern North American corn is very sweet and starchless in comparison to whatever variety is used in the Dominican Republic. As a result, the corn flavour was very subtle. Worse, the pudding did not want to thicken, and was plainly not even thinking about thickening after 30 minutes of simmering. So, I dissolved two tablespoons cornstarch in a little soymilk (I used soymilk instead of cow's milk), mixed it in and cooked for a few more minutes until thickened. While I thought the corn flavour was too subtle, on the other hand I thought the coconut milk was unpleasantly strong. I think this may have been because I used tinned. It started off tasting tinny. Thanks to the long cooking, the tinny taste dissipated, but it ended up tasting slightly soapy. Again, if you can get the right coconut milk (fresh?) this may not be a problem. This also makes quite a lot. I would say more like 8 servings. Thanks for the recipe...

W/no ice cream freezer, the texture is more crystalline than creamy & I wonder if using an immersion blender on the nearly frozen mixture might chg that to some degree. Using half milk & half vanilla-flavored yogurt may be another option. Next I think I will indulge my creative nature by making 2 half recipes ~ use half yogurt in 1 & whiz banana into the other. Adding nuts, choc chips or marbling w/a thick fudge sauce are options, but they prob should be folded into the nearly frozen mixture so they incorporate well & do not settle to the bottom.

The texture of the zucchini was really good, better than another zucchini lasagna that I've made. To accomplish the folding over of the lasagna noodles (step 9), which I was really confused about when I read the recipe, this is what I did: I took 4 noodles, put them side-by-side along the longest sides of the pan. To get them to hang over the sides I started all 4 of them in the middle of the pan, so half of each noodle was hanging over the side, and got 4 more noodles on the other side, starting in the middle.  So there were 8 noodles on the first layer, not overlapping, but hanging half over the sides. Then for the second layer I put 3 lasanga noodles side-by-side going the opposite way of the other noodles, like a normal lasagna, along the longest length of the pan. Then for the top I folded over the hanging noodles. It really worked great. I think this is a great method, because I found there were less crusty edges doing it this way! :) My only concern that I will change next time will be to increase the spices. The sauce seemed bland to me, and was quite thick too. With some minor adjustments I will make again!

I also used Yukon Gold potatoes which seemed perfect.  I had a little trouble with the directions, but that may just be me.  I wasn't sure if I was to cook the bacon in the same pan as I had cooked the sausage or if I should drain off the fat of each.  I decided to cook the sausage in one pan and the bacon/onion in another.  I drained fat off both.  If I use bacon next time, I will cook it first and then cook the onions and garlic after it is done in the bacon grease. I mistakenly mixed the sausage in with the broth and potatoes at the point where you are to simmer for 15 minutes, but that worked out ok.

I baked for a total of 25 minutes, since we were getting impatient and because I was making a smaller amount - it was hot through and through. I'm also embarrassed to say, we ate the entire thing in one night! It was that good!

When I looked at your recipes, I thought \"oh, I like mushrooms, I hope these fried ones don't turn out too greasy..\" and I wasn't disappointed!  Here's the formal review:\r\n\r\nI put flour, egg, and breadcrumbs in seperate cereal bowls because nothing else was  clean.  I didn't use nearly the full amount of flour; half would have been sufficient.  The egg got pretty well used up since it wasn't beaten to a smithereen.  I started out with about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and that was perfect.  However, the mushrooms I used were about 1\"-1.5\" in diameter, thus less coating.  I would recommend a smaller mushroom to get more of that bread-crumby-goodness on each mushroom.  By the time I got done breading all of the mushrooms, the first ones were set enough to fry.  I heated my oil a little hot, I think, as it took about 20 seconds for them to be a nice dark gold color.  They were putting off a ton of steam; thus, little grease.  For fun, I \"double dipped\" one of them (flour, egg, crumbs, egg, crumbs) and it came out a little crunchier, but nothing special.  They were eaten within minutes of frying, and the 2 reasons it took us that long were, well, they started out dang hot, and I snapped a pic.  They were nice and juicey on the inside with a burst of wonderul mushroom flavor, and tasty crunchy stuff on the outside.  My husband says to add salt, but I liked them as-were.
