The night before I defrost in the fridge and theb bake, it doesn't get watery at all ,and I believe baking the potatoes helps with that.

I made mine with shortening and the first time had some problems with the recipe.  The dough was rather hard and not terribly pliable.  Eventually I turned the dough and filling into a bar cookie and served it warm with a dollop of frozen non fat vanilla yogurt.  It was so delicious and flavorful, I had to try again. After checking in with the posting chef, decided that it may have had something to do with the flour and the age of the recipe. (That's why pastry folks use weights not measures.)  The second time I added all the ingredients except the flour and then measured that in 1/4 cup at a time alternating between whole wheat and all purpose flour. Eventually, the dough reached a perfect stage of firmness and softness at 1 cup whole wheat and 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour. At that point I had to incorporate the last bit of flour by hand as the ball was to firm for my hand mixer. Chilled the dough was very easy to handle.  Firm enough to roll, cut and fold but soft enough to yield a tender cookie.  The cookies were perfectly baked at 14 minutes and well worth the effort.  I was a little short on figs the second time so half were figs only and the other half a mix of figs and seedles raspberry preserves.  The combination was awesome and I'm already contemplating other fruit fillings for the future.

The crust was good, the meringue lovely (I used all 6 egg whites and adjusted the sugar etc to compensate).  The problem was with the ingredients and method of making the filling, I think.  I have only made LMP a few times and always used a recipe that had a lemon curd type of filling.  Never a problem with runny filling or flavourless filling.  Due to the rave reviews I thought I'd try this to see what I was missing.  My first question was about adding so much water to the filling ingredients.  I noticed many LMP recipes use a water and cornstarch based filling which seems to provide much less flavour than one using mostly or all lemon juice for the filling.  I also didn't understand adding unbeaten egg yolks to all that sugar and cornstarch.  That seems like asking for trouble along the lines of little bits of tough egg floating in the filling.  Why not combine the water and beaten egg yolks or even a little water and egg yolks?  Or add some of the cold water to the sugar and cornstarch, then add the rest to the yolks and combine?  It would prevent egg lumps that one reviewer said she dealt with by using an immersion blender.  Then the cooking instructions seem backwards.  They say to cook the sugar, cornstarch, yolks and water \"until thickened\", then add the lemon juice, rind and butter.  I did cook the sugar mixture until very thick (like icing or heavy  custard) but once I added the juice and the butter it became pourable and never thickened up again.  The pie has been in the fridge for 24 hours and the filling is still the consistency of melted ice cream.  Why not cook the filling with the butter and lemon juice in it so you can accurately judge the consistency?  Did I cook it too long?  Not long enough?  There is no real way to know.  The taste is okay but not special even using fresh lemon juice, sweeter today than yesterday we all agreed, and the meringue did not weep at all.  It looked lovely until we cut it and it poured itself out of its crust.  IMHO, just not worth the effort given the ease by which one can make a real lemon curd for such a pie and avoid the issue of \"will it or wont it\" thicken.", "calories": "476.3", "saturatedFatContent": "10.4", "cookTime": "55 mins", "sodiumContent": "245.0", "fiberContent": "0.8", "servings": "1 ", "date": "June 05, 2003", "sugarContent": "41.3", "proteinContent": "6.4", "fatContent": "22.0", "prepTime": "45 mins"}, {"category": ["Pies", "Pies and tarts", "Dessert"], "carbohydrateContent": "64.4", "cholesterolContent": "168.8", "review_date": "May 29, 2010", "name": "The Ultimate Lemon Meringue Pie", "review": "My mother has always wished for her mother's lemon pie, but she passed away before she ever knew the secret of her pie.

Every hour it took to rise was worth it.  I made each loaf differently.  The first was just as the recipe stated.  The second I worked in a good amount of olive oil into the dimples, sprinkled some fresh oregano & thyme, and grated Parmiagiano-Reggiano (a good amount) on top.  The first loaf had an exquisitely soft top- much softer than I had imagined it would be.  But its the taste in this bread that is just incredible.  Chewy, yeasty, and filled with that 'just-right' amount of crunch on the bottom.  The second loaf was harder on the top, and thusly more crunchy throughout, but just as good as the first.

Great soup. Super quick and easy to throw together with ingredients I had on hand. I altered the recipe quite a bit. I added onion, carrot, celery, a bit of salt, dash or garam masala, a generous dash of Kitchen King blend. Used 2c homemade chicken stock, 4c veg boullion and probably another 3c water (based on reviews, as I wanted a thinner soup). I also altered the method in that I started by sauteing the onion (maybe 1/2c) in ghee with a bit of asafetida and most of the spices. Then added the lentils and broth. Since I was using whole cardamon pods I added them with the bay leaves. Let it simmer gently for half an hour before removing the bay leaves and adding 1c finely diced carrots and 1c finely diced celery. I let the soup simmer for another hour or more before removing the cardamon pods, only because I had time, it probably wasn't necessary. The result was excellent - a light yet hearty soup with just the right flavour. Glad I added extra liquid - now I have more leftovers! :) Will definitely make again.

We can't handle things to spicy so I didn't put in the jalapeno pepper and I only put in a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I used a regular can of corn and didn't drain it  and regular brown rice instead of instant.  I put it in after I let the soup start boiling and ended up simmering it for about an hour and 15 min until the rice was the tenderness we like.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

DH and I grind our own wheat so I've been on the hunt for Whole Wheat recipes to incorporate in to our lives. Based on another reviewers suggestion I used 4 cups of Whole Wheat , 1/4 Cup Gluten and upped the water a tad. I did NOT add honey though as the other reviewer did. Once the dough setting on my bread maker was complete I pulled the mixture out and realized there was a LOT of dough so I divided in half. Oiled my 16\" pizza pan with olive oil and dusted with corn meal. Rolled out the dough then hand stretched to fit the pan. Sauced then topped with half and half toppings according to our likes and added 8 ounces of Mozzarella and a sprinkling of good Parmesan. Baked for 14 minutes but it wasn't enough for my liking so I baked another 4 minutes. The outside crust was crispy and the inside was soft and chewy. Even though I really enjoyed it I still prefer a little crispier crust so I think next time I will pre-bake for just a few minutes before topping and baking again. By the time I got the finished pizza in the oven I noticed my remaining half of dough had developed a dry skin. I gave it a good rub with olive oil, put it in a ziplock bag and put it in the freezer.

As mentioned, most of this recipe is spent waiting: waiting for the ingredients to come to room temperature and waiting for the rise.  The mixer does most of the work on the dough, so everything else just helps to make these fool proof. Always check the expiration date on your yeast just to be safe so all your hard work isn't wasted on yeast that won't rise.  Make sure everything is brought to room temperature before starting to make these.  I only added 3 1/2 cups of flour to the dough for the right feel to it.  To help it rise, I cover the bowl with plastic wrap, then put a dish towel on top of this too. I turn on the oven to about 250, and sit the bowl on the warm stove to rise.  The warm stove helps the yeast puff up, even if you have a cooler house.  It doubled in about 2 hours.  After I sprinkled on the cinnamon/sugar mix, I rub it onto the dough to make sure it was an even coat and mixed well.  They rose a little in the fridge, but the hot water pan puffed them right up.  I was waiting for the family to get up, so they were in the oven with the hot water about an hour.  I only baked them about 25 minutes, but I started checking them at 20 minutes.  I 'tweaked' the icing with a bit more cream cheese since it was a little too sweet and not enough cream cheese taste.  My husband and the In-Laws raved about these for breakfast.

My 14yo liked it, and my 6yo liked the loaf but not the sauce.  \n\nI found some of the instructions confusing.  For example, the ingredients call for 1.5 Tbsp of garlic, which is an odd way to measure garlic, other than powder, which I assume wasn't intended, since it was to be sauteed with the onion.  I ended up using 3 cloves, and minced them, and added them to the onions after they were mostly done.    Also it was unclear whether the oil used in sauteeing the onions was to come out of the 1/4 cup of vegetable oil or not -- I didn't measure what I used to sautee, but then didn't fill my measuring cup right to the top when measuring the 1/4 cup later.  \n\nFinally, I'll just add that it took me longer than advertised to make it.

Dad and I got together and made this for dinner for ourselves tonight. My kitchen smelt so good while this was stirring in the pot on the stovetop. Since the quantity of ginger and garlic was not mentioned, I used a 1 inch piece of fresh ginger and 4 cloves of fresh garlic(peeled, washed and finely chopped). I like to use all my veggies fresh as a personal preference and I try to avoid canned/tinned food, so I used 6 fresh tomatoes(4 Roma tomatoes and 2 Indian tomatoes). In addition to the green chilli, I also used 1/2 tsp. of red chilli powder. I used  3 1/2 cups of water to cook the tomatoes and cauliflower. As for the potatoes, I boiled the cubes of potatoes in water until they were  tender and just had to be stirred into the rest of the curry. I used 2 tsps. of salt in total for this delicious curry. This was a very tasty curry and we enjoyed it immensely with Tilda Basmati white rice. Very good with plain yogurt on the side:-) Next time, I will use just 2 potatoes. Otherwise, I will prepare it just as I did tonight. Thanks alot for a good dinner!

I think the flour and milk should be added alternately--I felt I was overbeating, as it took quite a bit of mixing to incorporate the milk into the stiff dough after all the flour was added. Although the butter will inhibit gluten development and help keep the cookies tender, I suppose it is just stuck in my head that cookie dough should not be beaten after the flour is mixed in to avoid developing the gluten. I found it difficult to roll the dough into 24-inch ropes and keep it an even thickness, so I divided the dough again so I only had to deal with 12 inches at a time. (You'll probably want to flour your board before trying to work with the dough.) I also had a problem twisting and making loops out of the 3-inch segments (at least the way I interpreted the directions), so I basically ended up with small circles. Unless I was making larger cookies, next time I would skip the labor-intensive roping and shaping and just shape them into slightly-flattened balls. With cookies of this size, the shape seems to get lost anyway by the time they are baked and decorated. I was trying to stay true to the recipe since I hoped to submit a representative photo, but in the future will take you up on your suggestion to shape them however I like (which for me will be the easy way). :) After tasting the baked cookies prior to icing them, even though I added extra lemon zest, the lemon flavor just didn't seem to come through so I used lemon juice rather than orange to thin the icing and just dipped the tops of the cookies in it instead of brushing it on.

I am not sure whether it made a difference or not. . . but I used clear Harris Teeter light corn syrup. because I wanted my candies to be as pale as possible.  I feel that the coconut dough was too wet and needed more coconut, about 16 ounces would probably have been perfect; as I noted in the store that the HT clear was runnier than the Caro.  I also added 1/2 t vanilla and 1/2 t coconut extract.  It is moist and delicious.  This dough was extremely sticky to work with.  I recommend wearing plastic gloves or putting it in a cookie press to fill your molds.  I also think that the dough would have a better texture if the coconut were processed in the food processor.  This is my picture here with the pink chocolates . . . what you cannot see is that the coconut dough weeps through the chocolate at the bottom because it is too wet, but they are fantastic, and I can't recommend white chocolate enough for these!  This is only my first attempt at trying this.   To get it into bars, I had to press out the dough between two silicone pads, freeze, and chop into squares, it was hard to do, but I couldn't work with it room temp except as balls.

Heat a stick of butter on LOW heat until it melts, then skim the milk fats off the top and pour the liquid butter out, leaving the solids behind.

Have no idea how to make this stuff but was having a little bit of nostalgia from my childhood, when my mom would make this.  Forgot about getting coconut milk (which she bought canned).  The package says you can use regular milk - I don't think it would be as sweet.  She used mushrooms, tiger shrimp and some kind of pork I can't recall - and omitted the curry powder because my siblings and I hated it.  I don't like curry at all, and prefer the regular color.

One could say they are connoisseurs as they are very picky on the type and \"add-ins\" for the potatoes.

First off, I didn't tell anyone I was doing anything different to see if I could get a reaction.  I didn't want to taint their views by knowing they are trying a new recipe.  I just put it out there just like every year.  They were delicious!!  Making them in the crock pot is brilliant as these are always the last thing I prepare for any meal.  Using the crock pot enables me to prepare them ahead of time and then not take time away from the guests/family right before meal time.  I prepared them the night before exactly as written in the recipe.  The next morning, I plugged in the crock pot.  I was afraid they might be dry so I added a thin layer of chicken broth (about 1/2 inch) on top.  As the potatoes warmed, I stirred in the broth. I would caution those who aren't onion/chive fans.

Being new here, I decided to try a recipe rather than use one of my own. This recipe looked interesting, but there was not enough time to cook them in a slow-cooker so I made them in the oven: 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.\r\n\r\nI made a few modifications to the recipe (besides using the oven and bone-in short ribs) which I shall definitely do again. First, I do not have a sweet tooth, so I drastically cut the amount of brown sugar. I decided to gradually add brown sugar to the rest of the mixture so I started with just under 1/4 cup brown sugar (packed a 1/4 cup measure to about 1/3\" from the top). I liked the taste of the sauce with this amount so I stopped adding more.\r\n\r\nThe other modifications I made were:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of 3/4 cup wine vinegar, I used 1/2 cup wine vinegar and 1/4 cup cider vinegar.\r\n\r\n2. The recipe calls for 1 cup beef broth. I used an entire can of double strength Beef Broth, 10 1/2 ounces.\r\n\r\nFor preparation:\r\n\r\n1. I browned the short ribs in vegetable oil. Using short ribs with bones, there is more fat in them (than in the original recipe) and I wanted to discard the fat before continuing with the sauce.\r\n\r\n2. I put the ribs in a Pyrex dish large enough for the ribs to sit beneath the rim and stuck them in the preheated, 350 oven while making the sauce.\r\n\r\n3. I poured all the fat/oil out of the browning pan, but left all the brown flour. To this I added 2 Tbs. butter and sauteed the chopped onion a bit while measuring then adding the other ingredients. The brown sugar was added last.\r\n\r\n4. When the sauce was done, I took the ribs out of the oven, covered them with sauce, then tightly sealed the dish with tin foil.\r\n\r\n5. After one hour I removed the ribs from the oven, removed all fat on the surface, turned the ribs over, then put them back in the oven for another 1/2 hour.\r\n\r\nI will definitely make these again. I'm pretty sure the short ribs would have been done in 1 1/4 hours, but I was disorganized and had forgotten to start cooking anything to go with them.\r\n\r\nOh, I could not get all the sauce in the baking dish I used. I probably have about a cup left. I intend to marinate chicken pieces in the left over sauce then cook them on the grill this weekend.\r\n", "calories": "976.7", "saturatedFatContent": "34.7", "cookTime": "9 hrs ", "sodiumContent": "979.1", "fiberContent": "1.5", "servings": "6 ", "date": "June 25, 2002", "sugarContent": "30.8", "proteinContent": "29.4", "fatContent": "76.4", "prepTime": "10 mins"}, {"category": ["Sauces", "Main dish", "Condiments, etc."], "carbohydrateContent": "40.6", "cholesterolContent": "163.9", "review_date": "January 12, 2003", "name": "Slow-Cooker Beef Short Ribs", "review": "This was REALLY good, Inez!!

It has about 75% fewer carbs and Calories  than regular sugar and 75% lower glycemic index. Can find WheyLow with that spelling on internet.

I made both the crust and the filling using frozen blueberries.  This is, by far, one of the best pies that I have ever tried!!  The only thing I did different was I forgo the egg wash and after the pie was cooked, I sprinkled a bit of white sugar on the crust.  This was an old trick I learned from my dear MIL.  The crust was fun to try out because of the vodka.  Once put together, it was literally \"easy as pie\" to roll out and shape in the pie crust.  My only comment would be that this dough could have possibly been stretched out to make 3 small pie shells.  I found there was just too much dough for 2 crusts.  I have a friend who has a blueberry farm and I get roughly 2 huge flats of berries each year...so I am always looking to find blueberry recipes that I can use up these frozen berries.

I have no idea what I'm doing, so I find recipes on Recipezaar with high ratings, scour the comments for hints and say a little prayer before any attempts in the kitchen. While these potatoes are delicious, I thought I would share what I learned in case there is anyone as desperately in need of help in the kitchen as me.\n\nFirst, I bought a mandolin specifically for this recipe, and I'm glad I did. Saved me A LOT of time. However, in putting half the potatoes in, I didn't separate them carefully enough... so in some cases, it was as though the slices were three times what they ought to have been.  DUH. Next time, I will take the time and care to lay the potatoes out in a single layer with a tiny bit of sauce alternating each layer to keep them from sticking together and not cooking thoroughly.\n\nNext, I made this recipe the day before because I've heard they taste better the second day. The first day, I tasted them and was worried that in putting the amount of salt called for in the recipe in that I had over-salted and ruined them.  But the next day, they weren't salty at all - they were perfect. (I cooked them the full hour; the next day, let them come to room temperature for an hour and then re-heated them at 350 for 30 minutes. Due to my not separating the slices enough, some of the potatoes were STILL not quite done.) But if I were to plan to eat them the same day, I would cut way down on the salt.\n\nHope no one needs as much help in the kitchen as me (if they do, they probably need another adult to watch them to ensure they don't end up killing themselves in a tragic vegetable-peeler-incident), but if so, hope this was helpful.

It is important to use a very flavorful salsa since most of the flavor will come from the salsa.  I used Green Mountain medium, but will use Clint's or Jardin's Medium Salsa next time.

This has a nice sweet/spicy taste and the lime comes through - I used the zest of a whole lime for a half recipe of marinade and juice from half a lime i didn't want to use too much juice as I was concerned about cooking the shrimp, I then squeezed the other half of the lime over the shrimp just as they were finishing up cooking.

This is SOOO awesome. I made this as one of the desserts to bring to my mom's tomorrow, and my family will be lucky if there is any left to arrive with me! I'm just kidding....this recipe makes a TON. So, here is what I did: I used mini chocolate chips, brown sugar, and I also added 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the brown sugar and butter mixture, all on the suggestions of other reviewers. Since the recipe directions don't specify, I *simmered* the brown sugar and butter on medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, until it was a caramel color and bubbly (I have never caramelized anything on the stove before this, so I wanted to pass that on). I also used a \"custom mix\" (that means I shook it around in a tupperware) of finely chopped pecans and almonds, instead of walnuts. When I was done making the candy, I popped it in the freezer for about 15 minutes, and then it was easy to break apart. I forgot to grease the foil (probably because I was SO excited to make this), but it was still not bad to carefully lift off. Greasing would be good, though. I was going to try Skor bits, but I'm glad I didn't, because those would have been TOO sweet, and this is a sweet treat!

The aroma of Braised Lamb Shoulder Chops simmering in juices flavoured with the recipe's prescribed herbs and seasonings adds to the anticipated enjoyment of dinner. \r\nWe love a lemon addition to our food, use it frequently, so this recipe immediately appeals to our taste preference.  The intelligent combination of the seasonings creates a subtility, yet enhances the sweetness of carrot, and onion, while toning down the acidity of tomato and contributes to the ultimate tenderness of Shoulder Chops.  (I also added one very large  thinly sliced white, mushroom for no good reason other than I could not help myself - I am a mushroom junkie...)\r\n\r\nTo complement our dinner, I baked two potatoes, cut them in half, but not right through.  (I wanted to be able to fold the jackets back over the flesh) I scooped out the flesh while still hot - (that took some doing) - mixed it with a fork until the lumps were smoothed away then added enough canola/soya margarine to bind the  flesh, returned the potato to their jackets, folded the skins back over the potato only enough to have plenty of potato protruding through the opening.  Then, scooped sauce and veggies over the potatoes and chops.  AMBROSIA, PURE AMBROSIA!\r\n\r\nI did find, however, that one hour simmering time was not quite long enough to tenderize the celery; but I am a compulsive taster, so I allowed it to continue simmering while I continued  tasting, until the vegetables were al dente.  Total simmer and taste time about 1.5 hours.  The sauce and vegetables are so tasty I could easily eat it on its own, like soup.\r\n\r\nServed with a bottle of chilled Terre del Sole, Pinot Grigio, from the 2001 Pasqua collection, made Smiley forget all about the airport woes.

I've never made an easier bread (and that includes quick breads). This is substantial with a wonderful moist crumb and a divinely crunchy crust. In case anyone making it needs the metric measurements, I used 780 grams of spelt (farro) flour and dissolved a 25 gram fresh cake of yeast in 1/2 c of warm water with 1/2 tsp. of sugar. The dough rose beautifully. Listening to other reviewers I used 2 smaller pans and cut the baking time quite a bit. But I don't think you could ruin this wonderful bread. I bet it's even good burned! One thing I'm unsure of...the recipe calls for 2 1/2 c water but doesn't say \"divided\". Even so, I went ahead and dissolved the yeast in 1/2 c water and added the remaining 2 c to the flour mixture. Also, 1 ingredient line is for \"1 tablespoon salt\" and the next ingredient line is for \"1/2 teaspoon salt\". As sugar helps boost yeast, I suspect it should read 1/2 teaspoon sugar. But no matter; a thousand thank yous to Thorsten for this winner. UPDATE: I'm making this once weekly, so practically don't have to look at the recipe.  Well, yes I do, as I accidentally added all the 2 & 1/2 c water into the mix along with the 1/2 c water that the yeast had dissolved in.  And yet, we like it better this way.

Will definitely be making again with a few minor adjustments.

The problem may be in making the roux, which is the carefully cooked, equal quantities of flour and butter. You must begin with low heat and the mixture must be stirred constantly to avoid scorching the flour. Start by melting the butter over low heat. When the foaming begins to subside, add the flour (do not include the salt and pepper yet) and stir constantly, watching the color of the mixture. It should become a light, nutty brown color. This may take five minutes or so. Do not go by the clock, but rather by the color. If the process is stopped too soon, while still white, it will taste like raw flour. If it gets too brown, the flour has scorched and it will taste burnt. As soon as the color is right, slowly add the room-temperature milk/cream in increments, continuing to stir constantly. When all of the milk has been added, turn the heat up to medium high and continue stirring until it begins to bubble, then reduce heat to a simmer and and continue stirring until it thickens. You now have the basic white sauce, b\u00e9chamel, upon which many other cream sauces are built. In this recipe, that is a cheese sauce.

I prepared them the night before exactly as written in the recipe.  The next morning, I plugged in the crock pot.

I sprinkled all the dry seasonings on the chicken, then put the chicken into the pan.  To the pan I added the fresh squeezed lemon juice.  It wasn't until the chicken was nearly cooked that I realized I'd forgotton to add the worcestershire when I put in the lemon juice, so I left it out altogether.

It woudl have been awesome if I had first, used REGULAR cornbread.  I used Jiffy which has sugar in it therefore it was SWEET dressing.  So think about the dressings you've liked in the past, and if they weren't sweet, just good and flavorful, make sure to use regular cornmeal.  Last, my family likes our dressing very moist, not the kind that hardens once it cools so that you have to cut it in squares.  Well, even though I added 3 c. of chicken broth and it seemed to be moist at that stage, it wasn't close to being moist after it cooked!  So make sure to bring the dressing to an almost runny consitency, more like a thin casserole and less like a cake batter, if you want it to be soft and moist once cooked.  Moist really shouldn't describe what you are trying to attain anyway.  It can be moist at many levels.  I think the distinction here should be: do you want it to scoop out EASILY like a squash casserole, or do you want it so firm you'll need a knife that can cut it into squares.  if you want more of the casserole consistency, you'll need 4-6 c. of broth, no less!  And keep in mind this won't be runny, but will be just way softer and lighter than if you put less broth!

I put the chicken in the egg mixture first and then took each piece out and coated it with cornstarch only. Then I put the chicken in the deep fryer. I used garlic powder instead of garlic.  For the sauce itself, I substituted the water and vinegar with orange juice. This will help enhance the flavor of the sauce.  Also I used about 1/3 of an orange for the  zest. It came out great! The only bad point  I had ..this recipe was time consuming and the unclear instructions. The real secret to this recipe is that true orange taste from the sauce.

First of all, I didn't have any bell pepper.  I only had 1 can tomato sauce.  I used the stewed tomatoes, pinto, kidney, and ranch style beans.  I also used diced tomatoes, but didn't have Rotel.  I searched my cabinet to see what I could use for more tomato sauce, and saw some \"no name beans in tomato sauce\" that someone from Canada left here a couple years ago, so threw them in.  (They were more like Pork and Beans, without the pork).   I also didn't have any chili seasoning, so I used a package of taco seasoning.  I added 2 tablespoons of chili powder in hopes of making it taste somewhat like chili.  I started it cooking on top of the stove, but, my pan kept burning, even though I added more liquid.  I put it into the crock pot and decided to taste it at this point.  Ate a small bowl,  it was good!  I cooked it in the crock pot for less than an hour while I made cornbread.

I've been making bread off and on for many years. The way I was taught was to use several different additives and dough conditioners.

Well, after trying this recipe, I now see that the other ingredients were completely unnecessary.  Here is how I altered the recipe. First, I upped the recipe to 5 cups of water and added the commensurate additional yeast, oil and salt. I used about a third of a cup of honey while blooming the yeast. I didn't knead this by hand. I have a good bread mixer and let it do the work. I also noticed that it was ready to be punched down in less than half an hour, and was ready for bread pans in less than 60 mins. Once in the pans, I let the loaves rise for about 30 mins before putting into the oven (next time I'll allow another 15-30 mins). This made three beautiful loaves.

This is a good fix for cinnamon stick cravings! I did a diet version and they still came out very good so I'm sure the full on version is heavenly! I used Healthy Life bread, fat free Philadelphia cream cheese, egg substitute, & a combination of Splenda with sugar & brown sugar. I omitted the powdered sugar and replaced it with a brown sugar & Splenda combination. I mixed it really well to get it nice & smooth. Next time I might try placing it in the blender to get it even finer but it worked out just fine as it was. I did 3/4 of these with bread and the remainder with 1 point tortillas. I found that I do like the bread better than the tortillas, suprisingly!
