I used my Kitchen Aid mixer for the kneading ( 3 minutes) and obtained perfect results using 4 and1/2 cups of flour.  The dough was just slightly sticky at first, but after rising, it was easy to roll out with a light dusting of flour on my board. \r\nUsually I use bread flour to get flaky, tender rolls, but the recipe called for regular flour and that is what I used.  Amazing! That saves money as bread flour is more expensive and not always on hand.\r\nThe recipe does get confusing at the end but keep in mind you only let the dough rise twice.  Once when you make the dough and again after you form them into rolls.  I buttered the tops immediately after taking them out of the oven and let cool.

Here's a few tips: 1) For first timer, to beat egg white to become foamy and peak, you MUST MAKE SURE the bowl and beater DOES NOT have oil. Must be absolutely clean. Don't use plastic bowl because oil tends to stay on it even after cleaning. Egg white MUST NOT HAVE even a slight egg yolk in it. Normally people beat egg yolk first, but I am lazy. I beat the white first, so I don't need to clean the beater when I use for egg yolk. But you have to make sure you prepare all the ingredients and work fast. Otherwise the foamy egg white will become flat. 2)You might need to consider reducing lemon juice or go with none. After reading other reviews, I reduced to 1 tbs, and still turned out too sour. I use fresh lemon juice. 3) Baking time really varies. Mine take 1.5 hours, using a square pan. 4) Cool it in the oven that you turn off so it doesn't sink. 5) If you try to bake it without the roasting pan containing water, the side will burn very fast.\r\n\r\nHope it helps!", "calories": "260.3", "saturatedFatContent": "7.3", "cookTime": "55 mins", "sodiumContent": "152.1", "fiberContent": "0.1", "servings": "6 ", "date": "April 25, 2004", "sugarContent": "21.6", "proteinContent": "5.4", "fatContent": "14.0", "prepTime": "5 mins"}, {"category": ["Healthy", "< 60 mins", "Time to make"], "carbohydrateContent": "49.8", "cholesterolContent": "110.0", "review_date": "October 13, 2008", "name": "Flat Dumplings", "review": "Just what the doctor ordered.

I took it back to my computer table, then looked at the cover and saw that it was The Great Scandinavian Baking Book by Beatrice Ojakangas!  I had read through the book at some point because it has little orange \"flags\" sticking out of several pages, but it is one of those books I had sort forgotten I had. It was so funny and strange I had to write and tell you, even though it's too late to start baking even \"One Hour\" Rolls tonight!

What gave it its most genuine chinese restaurant quality, was the breaded pork.  \r\n\r\nI added a little baking soda to the batter, and deep fried the pieces of battered pork, which made it very authentic.  Before I deep-fried the pork, I baked the pieces in the oven on a large cookie sheet for about 20 minutes, so they were actually already done all the way through.  \r\n\r\nThe deep-frying took very little time, and they came out golden brown.  If I hadn't pre-baked, they may have been a little undercooked inside.  I also used rice vinegar, instead of white vinegar, because it's been sitting in my cabinet for months, and I wanted to use it.  I used about a quarter cup less, because it was all the rice vinegar I had, but I didn't need to add any white vinegar, because it turned out just perfect.  I also sauteed my vegetables in a separate sautee pan.  \r\n\r\nEven though it sounds like I changed this recipe a lot, I'm sure if I had followed it to the letter, it would have been excellent too.  \r\n\r\nThe Chinese restaurant version I am used to has a red sweet and sour sauce, and this is not red, but it is very good!  If you want red, go buy it, unless you know how they make that stuff.  I would love to know.  But this sauce is excellent.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe batter is an excellent recipe for batter.  I plan on using it for onion rings and mushrooms too!  Thanks for posting!  \r\n\r\nBy the way...this recipe was about the only one without stars posted behind it, and I chose it anyway, because of the batter, which was what I was looking for to mimic the Chinese restaurant's version.

Then I had to ask Mirj how I could tell if they were 'good' produce.  She very patiently described what they should look like and what to avoid.  I watched until one day, I found 'Portabellos' that were 'obviously' very fresh and 'good'!  I snagged onto them, came home and printed this recipe.  Here it is, winter--much too cold to be outside grilling in Iowa--and I only have a George Foreman copycat grill to fall back on for inside during the winter.  I posted more questions for Mirj, which she again did her best to answer.  She thought I could probably do them in the 'copycat' grill, so I did.  Fortunately for me, I had the grill open almost the entire time they were cooking as I was turning and basting them with the balsamic vinegar/olive oil/seasoning blend, as Mean Chef posted a message after we'd eaten them that the 'copycat' grill needed to be left open, otherwise the mushrooms would get soggy...whew...that was close... ;-)  Well, after this experience DH and I certainly plan to have these again.  We had them for a quick and light lunch, served on the side with hotdogs, of all things!  The recipe says 6 servings, but I guess we're gluttons 'cause the two of us scarffed them all down!

When assembling in the crock pot I substituded spicy V8 for the tomato juice (I like to know I get some kick in any chili), added 2 shots of expresso, and a tablespoon of chopped semi-sweet chocoIate. At the end I added another teaspoon of cumin and cayanne after putting all ingredients in crock pot to add some heat and get more of a smoke flavor going.

I pulsed the broth in batches in the blender, to incorporate the nori... the result smelled just like shrimp broth while it was cooking-- really brought back holiday memories! :-) I didn't do slices of dough, just pulled off 1/2\"-1\" pieces and rolled them into \"unshrimpy balls\"... after boiling, I tossed them in seasoned flour/ cornstarch and pan-fried, then drizzled with fresh lemon juice/ served with spicy cocktail sauce: YUM!!

My fault for waiting as long as I did to pull the cooker off the burner, but I really would like to know what went awry.  I have an electric stove and the burner was set to 7 (med high). Now I know to pull the cooker off and abort the mission if it ever fails to reach pressure in a reasonable time.

I made these using white rice flour instead of the corn flour and 10 oz. of water instead of 12 oz. They turned out pretty good, but like other posters have said, they are a bit eggy - and I'm not sure they make a great tortilla so much as more of a crepe. My kids and I agreed that if they were a bit thicker they would make a good gluten free pancake! Having said all that, when I set out to make these I wasn't looking for a tortilla or a crepe/pancake, I was looking for something I could use as a pizza crust, becasue I didn't have any xanthan or guar gum. So, I made one of these a bit thicker than the others and then topped it with barbeque sauce on one half, and thai almond sauce on the other half. Then, I added my toppings and baked it for about 15-20 min. at 425. It actually turned out pretty good! The bottom was a bit soggy, but I think I could rememdy that by putting it on a baking stone next time (instead of a metal pan). In the end, I guess I am happy to have gotten some semblence of pizza! But, I'm still not quite sure how to rate these!\r\nUPDATE #1:   I tried again tonight with a thinner left over wrap from two nights before. I still couldn't get the wet texture of the wrap to leave my pan and jump onto my hot baking stone by the time I had all of the toppings on it. But, this time I only had the normal thinner wraps (instead of the thicker one I made specifically to make a pizza the first time), and baked it on a metal pan on the bottom rack in the oven and the outer 2/3 actually started to firm up and turn a bit crisp. I think I might be on to something....\r\nUPDATE #2:  I made a half of the recipe again tonight, using 1/4 tsp. garlic granules, and only using about 4 oz. water (still using rice flour instead of corn flour). I ended up spreading the batter onto a hot pan so it was 1/8\"+ thick. I cooked it until it was golen brown on both sides. Then, I let it cool and topped it with pizza sauce and toppings, and picked it up, and put it onto a hot (450) pizza stone.

As one who spent most of his life just outside Chicago, Italian (Eye-talian) beef is (was) a staple. And when I moved west a few years ago, I assumed that it was as ubiquitous as hamburgers and hot dogs. Not!! I looked high and low, but--sadly--this delicious sandwich was nowhere to be found. (I've since come across a couple Chicago-themed places that serve it, but I have to drive 60 mi. and plunk down almost $9 for a sandwich!) I've tried making it at home a few times with, at best, average results. And the last time I made it I had to try slicing it with a knife. The flavor was good, but you just can't get it right (i.e., thin enough) with a knife. And I just couldn't justify splurging for a slicer. But I was happy to stumble across one recently at a thrift store in like-new condition for only $12. Italian beef was coming to our table very soon!! And so I tried this recipe and, with some good, not-too-crusty/tough, French bread, you'd swear you're eating carryout from your favorite IB joint. Even my teenaged daughter, who doesn't usually care much for beef, went back for seconds! My tips for the recipe are to at least triple \"da gravy,\" and next time I'll probably quadruple it. You want your cooked and sliced beef completely submerged to absorb all the yummy goodness. But I would only double the garlic and Worcestershire; 2x on those two ingredients is plenty. And even at double it is plenty garlicky. But it's oh so delicious.

However on the second batch of cookie dough I did a little tinkering.  The first batch I followed the recipe to the letter, but I think there is an issue of word usage in the directions.  It says after adding the last bit of the dry ingredients to mix until dough is smooth.  This dough will not be smooth but more like pie crust, so make sure you mix until well incorporated.  It will be pretty much a heavy chunk of heavenly smelling dough that can easily divided to chill.  Also with as much ginger this recipe calls for, keep in mind even after baking these cookies will have a strong ginger flavor which is great for gingerbread cookie lovers like myself, but be prepared for the non-fans.  A nice coating of Royal Icing can help in this regaurd, or the traditional raisins.  My second batch I reduced the amount of flour to 2 1/2 cups, and reduced the ginger by half.  Since gingerbread is used for cut out cookies there is the risk of the dough becoming tough using the dusting of flour to keep it from sticking.  There is already quite a bit of flour in the dough itself so you will need even less flour dusting than say with sugar cookie dough, however after repeated dusting and handling, reducing the cooking time won't help having a rather hard cookie after cooling.  Using a half cup less flour there is room for dusting and handling no problem, but make sure you chill at the very least 3-4 hours and keep dough you're not using in the frige.  Reducing the amount of ginger by half gives the cookie a more mild ginger flavor which appeals to children far better as well as those finicky \"big kids\" who want a more sweet cookie.  Otherwise it's a great recipe for a traditional Christmas cookie making it well worth your time and love.", "calories": "134.2", "saturatedFatContent": "1.9", "cookTime": "8 mins", "sodiumContent": "94.6", "fiberContent": "0.5", "servings": "24 ", "date": "January 05, 2004", "sugarContent": "10.6", "proteinContent": "1.9", "fatContent": "3.2", "prepTime": "2 hrs 15 mins"}, {"category": ["Rolled cookies", "Cookies and brownies", "Dessert"], "carbohydrateContent": "24.3", "cholesterolContent": "15.3", "review_date": "November 05, 2010", "name": "The Most Wonderful Gingerbread Cookies", "review": "This recipe helped me through my first gingerbread cookie attempt, and even with the gluten free and vegan substitutions I made (Pamela's gluten-free baking mix for wheat flour, EarthBalance for butter, and Ener-G egg replacer for the egg), it was a definite winner!

I'm not really sure if this is really 'yours' or not, because I did a search on the internet for Ukrainian sausage recipes, and there were many hits but they all posted 'this' recipe, lol.. anyhow, where was I? I went with the least amount of salt, 4 ounces course salt, which equals 3 TBS.. I found that this was the same amount of salt suggested for the amount of meat/fat in a sausage book I have, so I went with that, and I found that the flavor was perfect.. not too little or too much.. I did smoke some rings of this, but overall, my favorite way to cook this is to boil it (unsmoked) for a couple hours, then brown it under the broiler on both sides.. delicious! The only deviation I made was in making the spiced whiskey - I grow tabasco's so I used those instead of cayenne, but it worked out great. I'm not sure what the spiced whiskey does, since the sausage is not spicy at all.. I'm thinking it was just passed down from some drunken gramma centuries ago, she probably did an 'oopsies' and spilled it into her meat mixture and said it was 'on purpose', but we may never know.. lol..

For those concerned about not having red or white on hand, I have found that using Sherry for either is a great alternative. You can pick up a big bottle in any liquor store for about $6.  For those concerned about the prep time, try using instant potatoes. They have changed so much over the last few years and honestly you cannot tell the difference.

I doubled the tofu and the sauce. I cooked the tofu then removed and set aside while I cooked some broccoli in the same pan. I mixed all the sauce ing. together and when the broccoli was done I added the tofu and the sauce and tossed until it was thickened and served with Jasimine rice. I used 1/2 tsp pepper flakes and I that was pleanty for us. The only thing I will change next time is how I do the tofu. I like to coat the tofu with beaten egg and then the cornstarch and then fry in veg. oil. Without the egg it was a little too crispy and kind of strange to us. I'll make it again with my changes.

It turned out very well, and the only thing I think I did a bit too much of was the herbs, I think I'll cut that back a bit next time. I ended up cooking the filling longer than stated  ( I also found, and watched the video of him making it, and the cook time was much shorter, but he made a much smaller amount) The recipe, as posted seems to be very much like what he used in the video, with regard to the amounts, with the exception of the meat, It looked to me in the video much more like one pound than two. The only other difference is that he used 2 egg yolks in the potatoes, which I also added. It was very good, and I will make it this was again!

You can try experimenting by adding cinnamon or any other herb of your choice)\n\nIn a separate bowl, mix:\n\n1 1/2 cups liquid (I used plain old water)\n1/4 cup liquid fat (I used olive oil)\n\nThen combine liquid into dry ingredients, mix. \n\nI found I didn't need to add any extra flour, the consistency is supposed to be sticky and not firm. I oiled my hands and shaped it into the roll form I wanted, then laid it onto my pan which was coated with olive oil. I cut an 'X' in my loaf... A nifty little trick you can use is to flour up your knife to do this, as just doing it without the flour can be kind of hard and not leave much of a mark at all.\n\nThe cooking time may vary, just keep an eye on the top of the loaf, when it starts to firm up and take shape a little, take it out and rub some melted butter on the top of the bread, then put it back in until it's finished.\n\nYou'll know it's finished when the top of the bread is a little brown.

This one does NOT disappoint. It was a HIT at this year's Thanksgiving feast. I followed the steps to the letter and it came out moist and delicious. Using regular sugar and flour are fine. Use REAL butter and REAL cream cheese. I did add 1 tsp of almond extract when I added the vanilla. I later read one of the reasons my cake probably came out so good is that I really beat the batter up during the cream stage and when I added the sugar. Easily plan 10 minutes if you are using a hand electric mixer, less if you have one of the big guns. Also, I read, when you beat in the eggs, don't beat too long, only 30 sec per egg - or your pound cake will get too airy. I ended up cooking it 15 min longer than stated. I wanted the inside cooked well. When you take it out, it still may seem jiggly, but as it cools, it firms nicely. Lastly, mix some powdered sugar with some lemon juice and make a nice glaze.

In step 8 it says to disolve the instant coffee in a 2 cup glass mesure (such as Pyrex liquid measure jug). Now Barbara notice that the recipe calls for only 1/2 cup boiling water. Step 9 is telling you to add cold water to the same glass measure to bring the mark up to the 1\u00bd cup mark. Simple? The reason for doing this is that step 11 tells you to cool the mixture.

As a former Olive Garden employee who has the taste of Zuppa Toscana burned in my tastebuds, I can truly say that my soup tonight came out as a PERFECT match.  I did customize this recipe with the help of previous readers, so I recommend following it like this...  I used 1 lb of hot Italian sausage, 3 medium to large potatoes UNPEELED, 1 small onion, 3 strips of thick sliced bacon, 4 cloves of garlic, 3 cups of kale (veins removed and sliced thin like ribbons), 32 oz of chicken broth, 2.5 cups of water, and 1 1/4 cups of half and half.  I removed the casings from the sausage and browned the meat in a skillet, then putting aside in a stockpot.  Then in the same skillet, I cooked the bacon and onions side by side, and put the onions in the stockpot, and went to work chopping up the cooked bacon and also putting in the pot.  Then I sliced up all the potatoes... leave the skins on!... it creates awesome ribbons in the soup that add texture and flavor.  I sliced them lengthwise and then in half into 1/4 inch thick triangles.  Then I put the chicken broth, minced garlic, and water and let boil for about 30 minutes, until the potatoes were tender.  Then I added the kale and half & half and let simmer another 15 minutes or so until the kale was tender as well.  Although the hot sausage left a reddish colored film on top of the soup, it properly seasoned the soup without needing crushed red pepper (which the real OG recipe includes).  Remember this soup should have a nice zing to it so I found that hot italian sausage worked beautifully.  What a fabulous soup for this chilly weather!!

Since I was no newbie to it I went in with confidence & changed a thing or two. If your into Robust flavor, spice & don't mind a tip or two listen up... \n\nONE- fry up some real bacon and let it hang on a paper towel once done.... \n\nTWO- please 4 the love of all that is good, saute those onions!!! (I would just throw them onto the leftover bacon fat and saute' from there) once the onions are translucent toss in the garlic and let it do its thang (watch it carefully so the garlic doesn't burn).... \n\nThree- if you Hispanic I know you have a little store bought Sofrito in the fridge (if you as blessed as I am, you'll have some of Wella's in a butter container or glass olive jar on hand) any who- toss a small spoonful of it into your onion mix, a pinch or two of some dry herbs (use common sense) and let it  saute... \n\nFour- Once that's done, toss the onion mix back to the pot, throw your sliced potatoes to the party and let them catch some flava -flave (I learned to throw in like 3 more potatoes to the recipe, if you are into a broth fest than use as many potatoes as the recipe asks)..\n\nFive- b/cuz me and little man love spice I throw my hot Publix brand (it's the best) sausage to the mix and also add a tbs of red chili flakes - toss it all together for about 2 minutes,  then add all the wet ingredients.  Also, I add a mountain of the Kale (at least 4 cups, if u want 2 get crazy like me go for 5.. since it wilts away I don't see it being a big deal.....Besides I'm trying to add as much green to little mans belly as possible)...\n\nSix - let the soup do what it does till the potatoes are tender and what I did was take a potato masher and gave it a mash or two for some thickness. (It's been record cold in the FL these past couple days and I wanted to get cheesy and make this nice hot green filled soup for me and my boy on a cold Sunday night so for the sake of my picture perfect day I wanted the soup a little heartier than brothy so I also added about a tbs of Wondra (thickener).  \nThis was our only course along with some garlic bread sticks and it was a freakin HIT!!! \nEnjoy!", "calories": "791.2", "saturatedFatContent": "24.9", "cookTime": "1 hrs ", "sodiumContent": "1800.2", "fiberContent": "5.5", "servings": "4 ", "date": "August 26, 2002", "sugarContent": "4.4", "proteinContent": "30.7", "fatContent": "54.1", "prepTime": "20 mins"}, {"category": ["Casseroles", "Main dish", "Side dishes"], "carbohydrateContent": "27.2", "cholesterolContent": "22.9", "review_date": "March 14, 2007", "name": "Carrot Mousse", "review": "Delicious, different way to eat your carrots.

I like the idea of making a cheese sauce instead of just adding the shredded cheese.  I made some changes for my taste.  I sauteed onions and garlic and added it to the mixture.  I steamed the broccoli until it was crisp tender to prevent it from turning to mush while baking.  I did make the cheese sauce with a shredded cheese blend from a bag.  If the sauce is made properly, there will be no  \"grainy\" texture.  The flour and butter needs to be cooked for a few minutes to ensure there is no raw taste.

I filled these with strips of jarred roasted red jalapenos, the chopped tomatoes and a mixture of goat cheese and queso fresco crumbles (I used shredded Mexican Blend cheese for the masa, though). They ended up being pretty spicy (the pepper strips were quite a bit \"kickier\" than I was expecting), but not unbearably so. Using a large cookie scoop (Pampered Chef) to portion out the masa, I ended up with 20 tamales. To appease DH, Mr. \"But Where's the Meat?\", I made some shredded poached chicken to place on top of the finished tamales. I also served them topped with some fresh tomatillo salsa and crema (which helped to cut the heat of the tamale filling). Oh, and I added a bit of garlic powder to the masa mixture, just because I felt like it. I really liked that this was a small manageable batch (plenty for DH and myself), because usually my tamale endeavors are these two-day-long, chained to the kitchen table, tamales coming out of my ears events.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, I wanted the cake to be non-dairy, so I used margarine instead of butter and soy milk instead of regular milk.  The cake had a very nice texture to it, rich and very similar to basboosa, a Middle Eastern semolina cake.  I do think the lemon flavor was a little too overpowering, the honey and lemon taste reminded me a little of cough syrup.  I don't think 4 tablespoons of honey was enough to sweeten the cake, especially with a full lemon's worth of juice in there.  I'm going to try to make this again, this time upping the honey to about 1/3 of a cup and cutting back on the lemon juice (or use a much smaller lemon).

Or it could come from not enough stirring. If you over or under cooked it, try the cold water test to check doneness. I relied on that way more than the thermometer. Google: candy cold water test.

You can use any kind of beef, such as chuck, sirloin, or fresh brisket, not an expensive cut.  Wash it in cold water, put in pot big enough so that it can be covered with cold water, add 1 box of un-iodized salt, cover, put in refrigerator for 3 days.  Turn a couple times during three days. (72 hrs. is sufficient, but, a few more or less won't matter.)  Meat will be grayish in color, but, this in no way affects the flavor. On cooking day, rinse off salt, put in pot and cover with fresh cold water.  Bring to boil, then, lower heat to a simmer.  No spices are added, just all the veggies incl. onions, taters, cabbage, turnip,and, maybe a parsnip or two, after the meat is fork tender. At this point, I remove the meat from pot, cover with foil, and put aside, then add the veggies. The only thing we ever drank with it was beer, and it's one of our very favorite dishes.  Just one comment.  I believe the person who wrote this meant \"gristle\", not grizzle.  Grizzle happens to be my daughter-in-law's maiden name.

I guess the kneading took care of them. It took me about 9 cups of flour to have a dough that was manageable. I also changed the filling a bit. I used 2/3 c. brown sugar (packed), 2/3 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. cinnamon, and I mixed it all together and sprinkled 1/3 of it in each loaf with the remaining raisins.

I should have worn my onion goggles for this recipe....  I thought to myself as soon as the pop rocks started to sizzle after dipping them in the honey, that I was going to get popped in the eyeball.  Hardy har har.  Then it actually happened!  I thought, \"I should get my onion goggles on.  But really, what are the chances it'll happen twice?\"  So I didn't.  But I can tell you now, that the chances are about 1 in 10, cause it DID pop me in the eye again! LOL  My preschooler and her BFF were \"hosting\" their first Halloween costume party.  We had over 20 kids and well over 40 total attending.  I bought one bag of Dum Dum lollies and every bag of Pop Rocks on the shelf, which amounted to about 9.  I was only able to make about 23 Acid Pops.  As I made them, I stuck them down through a piece of aluminum foil that was stretched tight over a bread loaf pan.  They looked a little gruesome as they slowly dripped and they hissed and popped at random (which was totally cool for the party).  I wanted to stand them up in a couple of really cute, and short, Frankenstein and Jack O'Lantern coffee mugs that I bought specifically for this, but the lollies were too short, and I didn't have a piece of styrofoam to stand them up in, so I had to lay them down.  But even after all the crazy it took to make these, the faces on our 20  preschooler's faces was more than worth it!  For most of them, this was their first taste of Pop Rocks and they were all in awe.  :D  Thanks for posting this recipe, I'm so glad I didn't give up after losing the first eye!  ;)", "calories": "31.9", "saturatedFatContent": "0.0", "cookTime": "0 mins", "sodiumContent": "0.4", "fiberContent": "0.0", "servings": "12 ", "date": "August 11, 2003", "sugarContent": "8.6", "proteinContent": "0.0", "fatContent": "0.0", "prepTime": "5 mins"}, {"category": ["Candy", "Dessert", "English"], "carbohydrateContent": "8.6", "cholesterolContent": "0.0", "review_date": "December 20, 2003", "name": "Harry Potter's Acid Pops", "review": "i tried dipping the lollipop in honey but there was too much honey on it and i think it could have tasted better. try just lightly spreading the honey on in stead of covering it thickly.", "calories": "31.9", "saturatedFatContent": "0.0", "cookTime": "0 mins", "sodiumContent": "0.4", "fiberContent": "0.0", "servings": "12 ", "date": "August 11, 2003", "sugarContent": "8.6", "proteinContent": "0.0", "fatContent": "0.0", "prepTime": "5 mins"}, {"category": ["Lunch/snacks", "Main dish", "Pasta"], "carbohydrateContent": "21.9", "cholesterolContent": "240.7", "review_date": "March 11, 2004", "name": "Garlic Pasta Sauce", "review": "I was trying to make a yummy cheese based pasta sauce.

As a former Olive Garden employee who has the taste of Zuppa Toscana burned in my tastebuds, I can truly say that my soup tonight came out as a PERFECT match.  I did customize this recipe with the help of previous readers, so I recommend following it like this...  I used 1 lb of hot Italian sausage, 3 medium to large potatoes UNPEELED, 1 small onion, 3 strips of thick sliced bacon, 4 cloves of garlic, 3 cups of kale (veins removed and sliced thin like ribbons), 32 oz of chicken broth, 2.5 cups of water, and 1 1/4 cups of half and half.  I removed the casings from the sausage and browned the meat in a skillet, then putting aside in a stockpot.  Then in the same skillet, I cooked the bacon and onions side by side, and put the onions in the stockpot, and went to work chopping up the cooked bacon and also putting in the pot.  Then I sliced up all the potatoes... leave the skins on!... it creates awesome ribbons in the soup that add texture and flavor.  I sliced them lengthwise and then in half into 1/4 inch thick triangles.  Then I put the chicken broth, minced garlic, and water and let boil for about 30 minutes, until the potatoes were tender.  Then I added the kale and half & half and let simmer another 15 minutes or so until the kale was tender as well.  Although the hot sausage left a reddish colored film on top of the soup, it properly seasoned the soup without needing crushed red pepper (which the real OG recipe includes).  Remember this soup should have a nice zing to it so I found that hot italian sausage worked beautifully.  What a fabulous soup for this chilly weather!!

(I would just throw them onto the leftover bacon fat and saute' from there) once the onions are translucent toss in the garlic and let it do its thang (watch it carefully so the garlic doesn't burn).... \n\nThree- if you Hispanic I know you have a little store bought Sofrito in the fridge (if you as blessed as I am, you'll have some of Wella's in a butter container or glass olive jar on hand) any who- toss a small spoonful of it into your onion mix, a pinch or two of some dry herbs (use common sense) and let it  saute... \n\nFour- Once that's done, toss the onion mix back to the pot, throw your sliced potatoes to the party and let them catch some flava -flave (I learned to throw in like 3 more potatoes to the recipe, if you are into a broth fest than use as many potatoes as the recipe asks)..\n\nFive- b/cuz me and little man love spice I throw my hot Publix brand (it's the best) sausage to the mix and also add a tbs of red chili flakes - toss it all together for about 2 minutes,  then add all the wet ingredients.  Also, I add a mountain of the Kale (at least 4 cups, if u want 2 get crazy like me go for 5.. since it wilts away I don't see it being a big deal.....Besides I'm trying to add as much green to little mans belly as possible)...\n\nSix - let the soup do what it does till the potatoes are tender and what I did was take a potato masher and gave it a mash or two for some thickness.

I was impressed and knew that I had to attempt making it.  I have the Magnolia Bakery cookbook at home so I found the right occassion to make it and I whipped it up!  It turned out PERFECT.  Absolutely wonderful and such a nice presentation. I like a subtle banana flavor and since the pudding part in this recipe is actually vanilla flavored and I didn't use super ripe bananas, it was very subtle.  If you wanted a stronger banana flavor, you could use more bananas and make sure they are plenty ripe (but not banana bread ripe - like almost black).  This dessert would be perfect for a picnic or barbeque.  It's not a fancy gourmet dessert by any means but just a good old fashioned southern pudding.  You must try to make this at least once.  I think you will be impressed and hooked.  I will definitely make it again.  Oh, in my cookbook it says to let the pudding sit in the fridge from 4-8 hours after assembling it. It says \"no more than 8 hours\".  I let mine sit for 3 hours and it was fine and I've heard of people letting it sit for 12 hours and it was fine as well.

Maybe it's the slightly misleading \"red wine\" in the title!  I made this today (Dec 13, 2010) and I will do a 2nd batch soon. This very crisp, fragile cookie is simply ideal to serve with a glass of wine, that's for sure!  I did find them a little too brittle (\"short\"), and will have to alter the recipe ever so slightly so they don't break so easily. But I did use leftover, finely grated bits of Parmesan and Grana Padano cheese, and only a little cheddar, so maybe that was too dry.  Another way around the \"shortness\" problem might be to use less butter and a tiny bit of milk (if that will work). I used fresh, chopped rosemary, ordinary paprika because I could not find my own smoked paprika, a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper, and instead of the minced sundried tomatoes I used our own South African minced pickled peppadews -- very tangy and nice. It's also such an easy recipe: I made it in my processor, and it all came together nicely as a dough.
