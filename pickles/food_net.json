If you can, I highly recommend using the Fontina cheese, I think this really adds to the creamy flavor. I used 1 cup of sharp cheddar as opposed to 1/2 cup. I used 1/2 cup wine, I don't see the need for a whole cup and frankly I'd rather drink that myself with dinner! I bought a bag of the baby spinach and that worked really well. Lastly, I opted out for the breadcrumbs. Unless you have the time to make these, you definitely do NOT want to use store bought breadcrumbs - they don't work well as a topping, they are more for binding. So without the breadcrumbs, I thought it tasted just fine. I also forgot to add the Parmesan, and trust me, this is so cheesy as it is, it probably doesn't need it!

I added a few sprigs of thyme from my garden and squeezed some of the lemon into the dish. Didn't think it was too bland - what I like is the simplicity of the dish - just a few things quickly prepared. The secret is to not cook any of the ingredients too long - especially the angel hair - only needs about 2 minutes after the water gets hot. The turns of the pan refers to the length of the pour of the olive oil - Rachael doesn't measure when she cooks.

I made this one without making the topping and it was FABULOUS.  Everyone that tried it, LOVED it!  I forwarded the recipe so they can make it.  A tip that may help if this is your first cheesecake...  the cheesecake should rise to the top of the spring form pan and the outside edge should just start to turn brown for it to be completely done cooking.  It will fall when you take it out of the oven so it is very important to take a thin knife to divide the edge of the cheesecake from the pan, which has been sprayed with the non-stick butter flavored spray with no flour.  The cheesecake did not crack at all and presented beautifully with no topping. In my oven, the cooking time was 1 hour 30  minutes at 325 with the temperature increased to 350 for the last 10-15  minutes.  The key is for the cheesecake to just start browning at the edge.
